From marketing and logistics to finance and product, decision-making is now dominated by data at all levels of most big private orgs (and if it isn\u2019t, I\u2019d be getting a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 put together, stat).<\/p>\n<p>So it might be a something of a surprise to learn that data, which could transform how we respond to the increasingly deadly disasters that regularly plague us, has been all but absent from much of emergency response this past decade. Far from being a geyser of digital oil, disaster response agencies and private organizations alike have for years tried to swell the scope and scale of the data being inputted into disaster response, with relatively meager results.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s starting to change though, mostly thanks to the internet of things (IoT), and frontline crisis managers today increasingly have the data they need to make better decisions across the resilience, response, and recovery cycle. The best is yet to come \u2014 with drones flying up, simulated visualizations, and artificial intelligence-induced disasters \u2014 what we\u2019re seeing today on the frontlines is only the beginning of what could be a revolution in disaster response in the 2020s.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<h2 id=\"The long-awaited disaster data deluge has finally arrived\">The long-awaited disaster data deluge has finally arrived<\/h2>\n<p>Emergency response is a fight against the fog of war and the dreadful ticking of the clock. In the midst of a wildfire or hurricane, everything can change in a matter of seconds \u2014 even milliseconds if you aren\u2019t paying attention. Safe roads ferrying evacuees can suddenly become impassable infernos, evacuation teams can reposition and find themselves spread far too thin, and unforeseen conditions can rapidly metastasize to cover the entire operating environment. An operations center that once had perfect information can quickly find it has no ground truth at all.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even getting raw data on what\u2019s happening before and during a disaster can be extraordinarily difficult. When we look at the data revolution in business, part of the early success stems from the fact that companies were always heavily reliant on data to handle their activities. Digitalization was and is the key word: moving from paper to computers in order to transform latent raw data into a form that was machine-readable and therefore analyzable. In business, the last ten years was basically upgrading to version two from version one.<\/p>\n<p>In emergency management however, many agencies are stuck without a version at all. Take a flood \u2014 where is the water and where is it going? Up until recently, there was no comprehensive data on where waters rose from and where they sloshed to. When it came to wildfires, there were no administrative datasets on where every tree in the world was located and how prone each is to fire. Even human infrastructure like power lines and cell towers often had little interface with the digital world. They stood there, and if you couldn\u2019t see them, they couldn\u2019t see you.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2146559\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2146559\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2146559\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg 3900w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2146559\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Flood modeling is on the cutting edge of disaster planning and response.

Temperature, atmospheric pressure, water levels, humidity, pollution, power, and other sensors have been widely deployed, emitting constant streams of data back into data warehouses ready for analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Take wildfires in the American West. It wasn\u2019t all that long ago that the U.S. federal government and state firefighting agencies had no knowledge of where a blaze was taking place. Firefighting has been \u201c100 years of tradition unimpeded by progress,\u201d Tom Harbour, head of fire response for a decade at the U.S. Forest Service and now chief fire officer at <a href=\"https:\/\/cornea.is\">Cornea<\/a> put it.<\/p>\n<p>And he\u2019s right. After all, firefighting is a visceral activity \u2014 responders can see the fires, even feel the burning heat echoing off of their flesh. Data wasn\u2019t useful, particularly in the West where there are millions of acres of land and large swaths are sparsely populated. Massive conflagrations could be detected by satellites, but smoldering fires in the brush would be entirely invisible to the geospatial authorities. There\u2019s smoke over California \u2014 exactly what is a firefighter on the ground supposed to do with such valuable information?<\/p>\n<p>Today after a decade of speculative promise, IoT sensors are starting to clear a huge part of this fog. Aaron Clark-Ginsberg, a social scientist at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rand.org\">RAND Corporation<\/a> who researches community resilience, said that air quality sensors have become ubiquitous since they are \u201cvery cheap [and] pretty easy to use\u201d and can offer very fine-grained understandings of pollution \u2014 a key signal, for instance, of wildfires. He pointed to the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.purpleair.com\">Purple Air<\/a>, which in addition to making sensors, also produces a popular consumer map of air quality, as indicative of the potential these days for technology.<\/p>\n<p>Maps are the critical intersection for data in disasters. Geospatial information systems (GIS) form the basis for most planning and response teams, and no company has a larger footprint in the sector than privately-held <a href=\"https:\/\/www.esri.com\/en-us\/home\">Esri<\/a>. Ryan Lanclos, who leads public safety solutions at the company, pointed to the huge expansion of water sensors as radically changing responses to certain disasters. \u201cFlood sensors are always pulsing,\u201c he said, and with a \u201cnational water model coming out of the federal government ,\u201d researchers can now predict through GIS analysis how a flood will affect different communities with a precision unheard of previously.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2146560\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2146560\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2146560\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg 3000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=768,483 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=1536,967 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=2048,1289 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2146560\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Digital maps and GIS systems are increasingly vital for disaster planning and response, but paper still remains quite ubiquitous. Image Credits: Paul Kitagaki Jr.-Pool\/Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Cory Davis, the director of public safety strategy and crisis response at Verizon (which, through our parent company Verizon Media, is TechCrunch\u2019s ultimate owner), said that all of these sensors have transformed how crews work to maintain infrastructure as well. \u201cThink like a utility that is able to put a sensor on a power line \u2014 now they have sensors and get out there quicker, resolve it, and get the power back up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He noted one major development that has transformed sensors in this space the last few years: battery life. Thanks to continuous improvements in ultra-low-power wireless chips as well as better batteries and energy management systems, sensors can last a <i>really<\/i> long time in the wilderness without the need for maintenance. \u201cNow we have devices that have ten-year battery lives,\u201d he said. That\u2019s critical, because it can be impossible to connect these sensors to the power grid in frontier areas.<\/p>\n<p>The same line of thinking holds true at T-Mobile as well. When it comes to preventative planning, Jay Naillon, senior director of national technology service operations strategy at the telco, said that \u201cthe type of data that is becoming more and more valuable for us is the storm surge data \u2014 it can make it easier to know we have the right assets in place.\u201d That data comes from flood sensors that can offer real-time warnings signals to planners across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Telecom interest \u2014 and commercial interest in general \u2014 has been critical to accelerating the adoption of sensors and other data streams around disasters. While governments may be the logical end user of flood or wildfire data, they aren\u2019t the only ones interested in this visibility. \u201cA lot of consumers of that information are in the private sector,\u201d said Jonathan Sury, project director at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the Earth Institute at Columbia University. \u201cThese new types of risks, like climate change, are going to affect their bottom lines,\u201d and he pointed to bond ratings, insurance underwriting and other areas where commercial interest in sensor data has been profound.<\/p>\n<p>Sensors may not literally be ubiquitous, but they have offered a window into the ambiguity that emergency managers have never had visibility into before.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, there is the extensive datasets around mobile usage that have become ubiquitous throughout much of the world. <a href=\"https:\/\/dataforgood.fb.com\">Facebook\u2019s Data for Good project<\/a>, for instance, provides data layers around connectivity \u2014 are users connecting from one place and then later connecting from a different location, indicating displacement? That sort of data from the company and telcos themselves can help emergency planners scout out how populations are shifting in real-time.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Data, data, on the wall \u2014 how many AIs can they call?\">Data, data, on the wall \u2014 how many AIs can they call?<\/h2>\n<p>Rivulets of data have now turned into floods of information, but just like floodwaters rising in cities across the world, the data deluge now needs a response all its own. In business, the surfeit of big data has been wrangled with an IT stack from data warehouses all the way to business intelligence tools.<\/p>\n<p>If only data for disasters could be processed so easily. Data relevant for disasters is held by dozens of different organizations spanning the private, public, and non-profit sectors, leading to huge interoperability problems. Even when the data can be harmonized, there are large challenges in summarizing the findings down to an actual decision a frontline responder can use in their work \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/01\/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world\/\">making AI a tough sale still today<\/a>, particularly outside of planning. As Davis of Verizon put it, \u201cnow that they have this plethora of data, a lot of cities and federal agencies are struggling with how to use it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, standardization is a challenge at all scales. Globally, countries mostly lack interoperability, although standards are improving over time. Amir Elichai, the founder and CEO of 911 call-handling platform <a href=\"https:\/\/carbyne911.com\">Carbyne<\/a>, said that \u201cfrom a technology standpoint and a standards standpoint, there is a big difference between countries,\u201d noting that protocols from one country often have to be completely rewritten to serve a different market.<\/p>\n<p>Tom Cotter, director of emergency response and preparedness at health care disaster response organization <a href=\"https:\/\/www.projecthope.org\">Project HOPE<\/a>, said that even setting up communications between responders can be challenging in an international environment. \u201cSome countries allow certain platforms but not others, and it is constantly changing,\u201d he said. \u201cI basically have every single technology communication platform you can possibly have in one place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One senior federal emergency management official acknowledged that data portability has become increasingly key in procurement contracts for technology, with the government recognizing the need to buy commercially-available software rather than custom-designed software. That message has been picked up by companies like Esri, with Lanclos stating that \u201cpart of our core mission is to be open and \u2026 create data and to share that openly to the public or securely through open standards.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For all its downsides though, the lack of interoperability can be ironically helpful for innovation. Elichai said that the \u201clack of standards is an advantage \u2014 you are not buying into a legacy standard,\u201d and in some contexts where standards are lacking, quality protocols can be built with the assumption of a modern data workflow.<\/p>\n<p>Even with interoperability though, the next challenge becomes data sanitation \u2014 and disaster data is dirty as \u2026 well, something. While sensor streams can be verified and cross-checked with other datasets, in recent years there has been a heavy increase in the quantity of citizen-submitted information that has to be carefully vetted before it is disseminated to first responders or the public.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2146561\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2146561\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2146561\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg 5429w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=768,525 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=680,465 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=1536,1049 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=2048,1399 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2146561\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">With citizens having more access to smartphones than ever, emergency planners have to sanitize uploaded data uploaded in order to verify and make it useful.

Well, yes and no.<\/p>\n<p>Sury of Columbia wants to cool down at least some of the hype around AI. \u201cThe big caveat with all of these machine learning and big data applications is that they are not a panacea \u2014 they are able to process a lot of disparate information, [but] they\u2019re certainly not going to tell us exactly what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst responders are already processing a lot of information,\u201d and they don\u2019t necessarily need more guidance.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, AI in disasters is increasingly focused on planning and resilience. Sury pointed to <a href=\"https:\/\/oneconcern.com\/en\/\">OneConcern<\/a>, a resiliency planning platform, as one example of how data and AI can be combined in the disaster planning process. He also pointed to the CDC\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atsdr.cdc.gov\/placeandhealth\/svi\/index.html\">Social Vulnerability Index<\/a> and risk tools from FEMA that integrate different data signals into scalar values by emergency planners to optimize their contingency plans.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, almost everyone I talked to was much more hesitant about the power of AI. As I discussed a bit <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/01\/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world\/\">in part one of this series regarding the disaster sales cycle<\/a>, data tools have to be real-time and perfect every time given the lives that are on the line. Kamachee of Team Rubicon noted that when choosing tools, he avoids whiz-bang and instead looks at the pure utility of individual vendors. \u201cWe go high tech, but we prepare for low tech,\u201d he said, empathizing that in disaster response, everything must be agile and adaptable to changing circumstances.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Kgw9OtLdmO\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/01\/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world\/\">The most disastrous sales cycle in the world<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The most disastrous sales cycle in the world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/01\/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world\/embed\/#?secret=Kgw9OtLdmO\" data-secret=\"Kgw9OtLdmO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Elichai of Carbyne saw this pattern in his sales. There\u2019s a \u201csensitivity in our market and the reluctance from time to time to adopt\u201d new technologies he said, but acknowledged that \u201cthere is no doubt that AI at a certain point will provide benefits.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Naillon of T-Mobile had similar views from the operator perspective, saying that \u201cI can\u2019t say that we really leverage AI very much\u201d in the company\u2019s disaster planning. Instead of AI as brain, the telecom company simply uses data and forecast modeling to optimally position equipment \u2014 no fancy GANs required.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of planning, AI has helped in post-disaster recovery, and specifically around damage assessments. After a crisis transpires, assessments of infrastructure and private property have to be made in order for insurance claims to be filed and for a community to move forward. Art delaCruz, COO and president of Team Rubicon, noted that technology and a flourish of AI has helped significantly around damage assessments. Since his organization often helps rebuild communities in the course of its work, triaging damage is a critical element of its effective response strategy.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"There\u2019s a brighter future, other than that brightness from the sun that is going to burn us to a crisp, right?\">There\u2019s a brighter future, other than that brightness from the sun that is going to burn us to a crisp, right?<\/h2>\n<p>So AI today is helping a bit with resilience planning and disaster recovery and not so much during emergency response itself, but there is certainly more to come across the entire cycle. Indeed, there is a lot of excitement about the future of drones, which are increasingly being used in the field, but there are concerns long term about whether AI and data will ultimately cause more problems than they solve.<\/p>\n<p>Drones would seem to have an obvious value for disaster response, and indeed, they have been used by teams to get additional aerial footage and context where direct access by responders is limited. Kamachee of Team Rubicon noted that in the Bahamas on a mission, response teams used drones to detect survivors, since major roads were blocked. The drones snapped images that were processed using AI, and helped the team to identify those survivors for evacuation. He described drones and their potential as \u201csexy; very, very cool.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2146562\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2146562\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2146562\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg 5517w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=1536,1011 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=2048,1348 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2146562\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aerial views from drones can give disaster response teams much better real-time information, particularly in areas where on-the-ground access is limited.

Yet, there is one caveat: will the AI algorithms themselves cause new problems in the future?<\/p>\n<p>Clark-Ginsburg of RAND, perhaps supplying that typical RANDian alternatives analysis, said that these solutions can also create problems themselves, \u201ctechnological risks leading to disaster and the world of technology facilitating disaster.\u201d These systems can break, they can make mistakes, and more ominously \u2014 they can be sabotaged to increase chaos and damage.<\/p>\n<p>Bob Kerrey, a co-chair of the 9\/11 Commission, former senator and governor of Nebraska, and currently the board chairman of Risk &amp; Return, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/risk-and-return\/\">a disaster response VC fund and philanthropy I profiled recently<\/a>, pointed to cybersecurity as increasingly a wild card in many responses. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t a concept called zero days \u2014 let alone a market for zero days \u2014 in 2004 [when the 9\/11 Commission was doing its work], and now there is.\u201d With the 9\/11 terrorist attacks, \u201cthey had to come here, they had to hijack planes \u2026 now you don\u2019t need to hijack planes to damage the United States,\u201d noting that hackers \u201ccan be sitting with a bunch of other guys in Moscow, in Tehran, in China, or even your mother\u2019s basement.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Data is a revolution in the making for disaster response, but it may well cause a whole second-order set of problems that didn\u2019t exist before. What is giveth is taketh away.

Hana is the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/MagicBell.com\">MagicBell<\/a>, a new startup she created with Josue Montano that just recently graduated from Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2021 cohort. MagicBell is a full-featured, plug-and-play notifications inbox aimed at developers who want to build one into their own product, but don&#8217;t want to have to build one themselves from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>Hana&#8217;s experience as an entrepreneur spans multiple companies, including her last one which she grew to significant success in terms of annual revenue. She&#8217;s also a proud transgender woman, who underwent her transition mid-way through her existing history as a founder and entrepreneur. Hana talks to us about the challenges she faced taking on her transition in an industry where the focus is often exclusively on how hard you&#8217;re hustling and what you&#8217;re building next, and about her origin story as a founder coming from an environment where there weren&#8217;t necessarily many examples with similar life experience to look to for inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>During our chat, Hana also shared lots of insight into YC, and what it provides founders, as well as perspective on what it was like going through the program during a global pandemic in a remote context. Finally, she offers some great context on finding your first investors and customers as a distributed team.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>We loved talking to Hana, and we hope you love the episode.

I think it&#8217;s fair to say we&#8217;ve lived through a very strange reality this past year. With all the chaos and change, we&#8217;re led to a foundational question: what&#8217;s the purpose of speculative fiction and its adjacent genres of science fiction and fantasy when so much of our world seems to already embody the fantastical worlds these works depict?<\/p>\n<p>So I got our occasional fictional columnist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eliotpeper.com\">Eliot Peper<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eliotpeper.com\/p\/blog-page.html\">the author of Veil, the three part Analog Series and other speculative fiction novels<\/a> on the Gmail for an epistolary conversation on digesting 2020, the meaning of speculative fiction, and the future of art.<\/p>\n<p><em>This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed.<\/em><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>Danny Crichton<\/strong>: I&#8217;m curious about the future of speculative fiction. We just went through a devastating year with the pandemic and a number of major climate disorders \u2013 the types of events that are among the fodder for this genre. How do you keep speculating when reality always seems to catch up with the amygdala of our imaginations?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eliot Peper<\/strong>: Current events are a painful reminder that unlike fiction, reality needn&#8217;t be plausible. The world is complex and even the wisest of us understand only a tiny sliver of what&#8217;s really going on. Nobody knows what comes next. So while it may feel like we&#8217;re living in a science fiction novel, that&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve\u00a0<i>always been\u00a0<\/i>living in a science fiction novel. Or maybe speculative fiction is more real than so-called\u00a0realist\u00a0fiction because the only certainty is that tomorrow will be different from today and from what we\u00a0expect.\u00a0Depicting a world without fundamental change has become fantastical.<\/p>\n<p>As a writer of speculative fiction, I&#8217;m an enthusiastic reader of history. And in reading about the past to slake my curiosity and imagine possible futures, I&#8217;ve learned that the present is exceedingly contingent, fascinating, and fleeting. For me, speculative fiction is less about prediction than it is about riffing on how the world is changing like a jazz musician might improvise over a standard. Accuracy only happens by mistake. The most interesting rendition wins because it makes people think, dream,\u00a0<i>feel<\/i>. And thanks to technological\u00a0leverage, to a greater and greater extent people are inventing the future \u2013 for better and for worse.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m not worried about reality catching up with speculative fiction because speculative fiction is rooted in the human experience of reality. Every black swan event is simply new material.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crichton<\/strong>: So this gets at a challenge that I think blurs the line between realist and speculative fiction and makes these works so hard to categorize. To me, the reality of the pandemic isn&#8217;t the black swan that a novel virus could take hold across the planet (after all, pandemics are actually quite common in history), but rather the black swan of the completely shambolic response that we witnessed, one that was not at all well-coordinated.<\/p>\n<p>If I were designing a speculative fiction scenario, I don&#8217;t think I could come up with &#8220;we develop a cure extremely rapidly thanks to the progress of medical science, but the general\u00a0day-to-day response of people is to massively inflate the death totals through their own actions.&#8221; When I think speculative, I think spectacular \u2014 something exceptional, but this particular black swan shows the power of the mundane actions of our lives to influence the course of events.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Peper<\/strong>:\u00a0Speculative fiction is all about asking &#8220;what if?&#8221; What if a lone astronaut got stranded on Mars? What if genetic engineers resurrected dinosaurs and stuck them in an amusement park? What if we are all living in a simulation? The question that sparked my latest novel,\u00a0<i>Veil<\/i>, is &#8220;what if a billionaire hijacked the climate with geoengineering?&#8221; These questions are hooks. They capture the imagination and pique curiosity. That&#8217;s all well and good, but it&#8217;s only a starting point.<\/p>\n<p>To pay off a speculative setup, you need to keep the dominos falling as second-, third-, and fourth-order effects ripple out through the story. Momentum builds. Progressive complications tighten the ratchet. Unexpected reversals fling the reader forward. If an earthquake flattens San Francisco in your story, it&#8217;s easy to imagine potential physical consequences: the Bay Bridge collapsing, BART flooding, the power going out, gas leaks, fires, etc. It&#8217;s less obvious but at least as important to imagine the potential social consequences: Do people risk their lives to rescue their neighbors or fight over limited emergency supplies? How do the governor and the president respond given their particular personalities, incentives, and constituencies? How might such an event rework the social fabric of the Bay Area? (Also, crucially,\u00a0<i>where is Dwayne Johnson?<\/i>)\u00a0How people respond to events is integral to how events play out.<\/p>\n<p>Published in April 2020, Lawrence Wright&#8217;s\u00a0<i>The End of October<\/i>\u00a0does an eerily good job extrapolating the messy, cascading social and political reactions to a global pandemic. Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s\u00a0<i>Gal\u00e1pagos<\/i>\u00a0depicts an apocalyptic scenario driven by such mundane, shambolic human shortsightedness that it feels nearly absurd enough to be realistic. While some science fiction overindexes technological change, Ada Palmer&#8217;s brilliant <em>Terra Ignota<\/em> series imagines the cultural, political, and sociological aspects of a fictional future with extraordinary rigor. So often, human behavior is the X-factor that transforms and amplifies the impacts of the original scenario,\u00a0shaping a new world in the process.<\/p>\n<p>This hints at a deeper question though: What is fiction for?<\/p>\n<p>When I write fiction, I am not trying to accurately depict or anticipate reality. I&#8217;m trying to create an experience, to take the reader on a journey that is compelling, surprising, and fulfilling. Even though part of the fun might be extrapolating a scenario rooted in a particularly intriguing facet of the real world, success isn&#8217;t getting things right. Success is a reader turning pages deep into the night to find out what happens next in a story they can&#8217;t put down and won&#8217;t soon forget.<\/p>\n<p>Neil Gaiman likes to say that fairy tales are\u00a0more than true \u2013 not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten. When it comes to speculative fiction, I love stories that reveal a deep emotional truth or illuminate an underlying force shaping the course of history even if they are wildly but entertainingly wrong about literal details. That doesn&#8217;t mean that striving for technical accuracy is bad, just that it isn&#8217;t always the point. The point might instead be to make you think, to make you feel, to make you imagine how the world might be different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crichton<\/strong>: So on that last point, I&#8217;m curious how you think about imagination and its power for change. Obviously, art has had a sustained and powerful impact\u00a0on the imagination of people throughout\u00a0history, and there are often artistic antecedents\u00a0to large societal, cultural, and political changes. Part of its power historically though, at least from my perspective, was its rarity and its ability to surprise.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we are just subsumed in imaginative worlds, from video games to movies to streaming television\u00a0shows to books and graphic novels and on and on. If you read time-use studies, Americans are awash in imaginative contexts for potentially a majority of their waking hours. I feel like I&#8217;ve been increasingly seeing this gap between the extreme breadth of imagination available in our art, but the extreme\u00a0narrowness for change in our daily lives. Is that a threat to the ability of art to provoke change? Is speculation still an activity that can lead to action?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Peper<\/strong>: Speculation is part of what it means to be human. Before we make a choice, we imagine the possible consequences. We simulate potential futures in daydreams before committing\u00a0to them in reality. Our mental projections are often wrong, but they are also often useful. For better and for worse, thought experiment is foundational to our internal lives. This individual dynamic scales to the human collective: Imagining a better future is the first step toward building one.<\/p>\n<p>Art is a vehicle for imagination. A filmmaker\u00a0codifies their vision in a movie that others can watch and, in watching, exercise\u00a0their respective imaginations \u2013 sometimes even sparking new creative\u00a0endeavors that\u00a0spin off into yet more projects that together form what we call culture. Technology has made more movies, books, songs, poems, photos, paintings, comics, podcasts, and games available and accessible to more people than ever before. Imagined worlds are an integral part of the real world as we experience it, layering meaning and possibility onto actual events. We are all interpreting reality for each other all the time, transforming it in the process. The increasing density and intensity of that process is the result of a growing population that is knitting itself together ever more tightly along ever more dimensions.<\/p>\n<p>But technology hasn&#8217;t just made new artistic mediums possible and changed the ways in which people make, discover, and experience art. Technology amplifies the impact of human choices. Hippocrates couldn&#8217;t have invented an mRNA vaccine, Genghis Khan couldn&#8217;t have pressed a button to initiate a nuclear apocalypse, and Odysseus had to build his Trojan Horse out of wood instead of code.<\/p>\n<p>Our tools give us superpowers our ancestors never imagined and the consequences of our decisions scale accordingly. Because technical ingenuity is morally neutral, technological development ratchets up the stakes for timeless questions of human agency \u2013 what does it mean to live a good life, to contribute to the greater good, to be a good ancestor? This is the moral geography to which artists offer diverse, imperfect, contradictory, and occasionally\u00a0invaluable maps. So in a certain sense, the more technology empowers us, the more we need art.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s an old saw from Mark Twain about how truth is stranger than fiction, and I think it&#8217;s fair to say we&#8217;ve lived through a very strange reality this past year.

Apple does believe in privacy and user control &#8212; you can tell that from the way the company has built its technology to do things like on-device processing or permissions toggles that let people decide what their apps can and cannot do.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"o4wmAxOCnW\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know\/\">Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature has arrived \u2014 here&#8217;s what you need to know<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature has arrived \u2014 here&#8217;s what you need to know&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know\/embed\/#?secret=o4wmAxOCnW\" data-secret=\"o4wmAxOCnW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>But Apple will also benefit from this particular privacy reform, too. Its own first-party apps can collect data and share it with other first-party apps. That means what you do in apps like the App Store, Apple News, Stocks and others can be used to personalize Apple&#8217;s own ads. And the company is prepared to capitalize on this opportunity too, with the addition of a new ad slot on the App Store (in <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/21\/04\/26\/german-advertisers-file-antitrust-complaint-over-apples-app-tracking-transparency?utm_medium=rss\">the Suggested section<\/a> on the Search tab.) If it wants to roll out more ads over time to other businesses &#8212; perhaps, those podcasts it got newly interested in after Spotify did? Or in its streaming TV service or fitness solution? Perhaps the ads it sells in Apple News? &#8212; then it would have access to valuable data it could use. Oh and the next time you open the App Store or Apple News, you won&#8217;t be bothered with one of those pesky warnings! Nope &#8212; that&#8217;s only for <em>third<\/em>-parties, a <em>very<\/em> important distinction!

The companies had earlier announced their plans to make it easier for Facebook users to stream music and podcasts from the Facebook app. On Monday, this integration began rolling out in the form of a miniplayer experience that allows Facebook users to stream from Spotify through the Facebook app on iOS or Android.<\/p>\n<p>The feature is available to both free and paying Spotify users and will allow them each to hear the full song or podcast episode being shared. However, free users will then be moved into &#8220;shuffle&#8221; mode if they continue to listen after the song plays.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this integration is that it&#8217;s not actually streaming Spotify through Facebook. The miniplayer activates and controls the launch and playback in the Spotify app \u2014 which is how the playback is able to continue even as the user scrolls on Facebook or if they minimize the Facebook app altogether. This gives the appearance of Facebook doing the streaming. (Songs on social! Cue Myspace vibes!)<\/p>\n<p>Spotify says users can&#8217;t upgrade to Spotify Premium from the miniplayer directly, so there&#8217;s no rev share there. It&#8217;s also paying the royalties on streams, as usual. But it&#8217;s getting massive distribution through Facebook, driving signups and repeat usage, while Facebook gets a way to keep users on its app longer. Win-win.

This new iOS app is designed to solve more difficult email problems, like handling overloaded inboxes and mail that spies on you. The app will automatically block tracking pixels (read receipts), suggest emails to unsubscribe from, index your entire history for faster searches, stop ad targeting, and more. Like Basecamp&#8217;s Hey, users can also decide who can or cannot enter their inbox, too. And when you want to see your promotions, they&#8217;re provided in a visual feed that&#8217;s more engaging.<\/p>\n<p>The service, which is also available on the web, works with OnMail email addresses, as well as other accounts like those from Microsoft, Google and others. It will later introduce an Android app, calendar support, Yahoo and Microsoft Exchange support, and two-factor.

Josh Constine and Facebook&#8217;s audio czar Fidji Simo. The format continues to sparkle, as I was once again forced to choose between MSNBC&#8217;s Rachel Maddow or Lawrence O&#8217;Donnell and just plain audio. JPA won going away. The talk was crisp and the strategies thick with optimism about the creator economy. Monetization, priming the emergent pump, etc. If this were the Gold Rush, it would be blue skies ahead for picks and shovels and pans.<\/p>\n<p>It remains hard to listen to the creator talk. If this is the moment for creators, then what is the moment for us listening? The question is who gets the short end of the crypto stick, a zero sum game where the losers are the equivalent of who buys high and sells low. I guess in the elegant world of startups, being one and not the other nine of ten is worth it.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It&#8217;s still damn exciting to see the outcome at a safe distance from ground zero. Once the tech companies run out of slots at the start of the race, there will be plenty of industries waiting for the early smoke to clear. Walmart, table for two? This is not a live audio story but rather a realignment of the media industries around notifications. Let&#8217;s approach the rebuild of the economy and our way of life from the inside out, or backwards in a kind of reverse engineered insight replayed forward like a Beatles guitar solo.<\/p>\n<p>Back before the virus, we thought of life as weekday and weekends, work week or vacation, a series of not-holidays punctuated by long weekends every 6 to 8 weeks or so.We paced ourselves in waves: not liking Mondays to hump days to going to the movies on Friday to watching the political shows on Sunday. Enduring the nightmare that was Trump, sedating us with the binge economy as it surfed the streaming disruption, addicted to our phones and awestruck by the possibilities of the hive mind. Things changed, and then the plague struck.<\/p>\n<p>Now we realized our folly, not in assuming the unassumable but in thinking we had any clue at all of how much time we had to dream about the future. Our belief in technology was still there, but not necessarily how it would work. Saving us was a goal, not a sure thing or even close. We held our breath. And got incredibly lucky. Time inverted itself, and in surviving we found a desperate grace in treasuring our networks of family and friends.<\/p>\n<p>As much as we knew everything was different, we were shocked at how quickly we adapted to the crisis. The rapid deployment of mobile and social technology over the previous couple decades was suddenly ratified, accelerated, and made table stakes. Not surprisingly the tech companies were able to consume the wave; the startup surge was financed by eating its own dog food. Remember Y2K, where it was still not a sure thing there was any real ROI for collaboration, or groupware as it was pigeonholed.<\/p>\n<p>It got a lot harder to say digital collaboration was not realistic. The Cloud made corporate transformation a subscription service going in and pivoting to market fit a viable exit strategy. Startups could scale up without multi-million dollar bets, leaving enterprise incumbents with no choice but to adopt Software As A Service to survive. Consumer laptops, TCPIP, and 2400 baud modems became the platform where continuous innovation found a home, virtualizing the office as a set of familiar services deployed both on desktop and phones.<\/p>\n<p>Notifications became less a source of interruption and more the quickest way to manage the converging streams of work and personal life. These intermittent alerts allowed us to navigate multiple conversations and interactions on an as-needed basis. Collaboration tools orchestrated the abstraction of email with group messaging, video conferencing became a time saver and easy onboarding tool, screen sharing an IT replacement. And all sat on the notification backbone, reducing channel conflict and shifting the social aspects of team engagement to a more personal basis. And then the pandemic happened.<\/p>\n<p>Is it any wonder, the Bowie song asks. Notification etiquette kicks in at daybreak with the overnight roundup, tracks the news throughout while avoiding the repetitive eyeball-baiting of the cable networks, and creates a calendar of things to click on or store for free time or cram for a meeting. No, it&#8217;s not any wonder that audio fits more and more into this work-from-wherever climate shift. Notification chimes differentiate between critical alerts, parkable alerts, and ignorable scroll-offs. Newsletters become havens for binging cached 10 minute reads, managing live audio and recorded podcasts, and a rallying point for influencer analytics. This last one offers value for not just creators but consumers, also known as tippers.<\/p>\n<p>The creator bandwagon sounds promising, but who cares which major platform captures the pole position? I like Clubhouse&#8217;s work in establishing a complementary social cloud via notifications. I like Twitter Spaces as a driver to squeeze a record button into the UI for all, just as Anchor does for podcasting. I like the idea of Facebook sneaking onto the playing field by allowing Instagram to turn off video. Wow, thanks. I love how Josh Constine seems to have landed in just the right place to triangulate his venture casting chops, reportorial finesse, handy summarizing of the calls, and matter-of-fact direct to podcast strategy.<\/p>\n<p>But these early winners in format and style should soon give way to a more constructive dialogue between creators and their listeners. Newsletter platforms seem to have made the case that a few hit writers will pay for developing tools to support subscriptions, distribution, legal services, analytics, and more. I keep wanting to backchannel directly with specific people in the room, but Clubhouse doesn&#8217;t want that to happen natively. We&#8217;re live audio, not chat, they don&#8217;t say but imply. What if listeners could sign up for receiving (and sending) commentary via some form of group @mention. Moderators could tap into that and invite people onstage to engage with speakers. Organic discovery of talent and impact.

did Atlanta become a top breeding ground for billion-dollar startups in the Southeast?"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Over the past five years, the Southeastern region, led by Atlanta, has gone from being &#8220;one of the best kept secrets&#8221; in tech, to a vibrant ecosystem teeming with a herd of the billion dollar tech businesses that are referred to in the investment world as &#8220;unicorns&#8221; (thanks to their supposed rarity).<\/p>\n<p>In those five years venture capital investments surged to $2.1 billion in the region, with $1 billion invested in the last year alone, according to Lisa Calhoun, a partner with the Atlanta based investment firm, <a href=\"https:\/\/valor.vc\/\">Valor Ventures<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s indicative of the entrepreneurial talent coming from the network of private and public schools across the region like Georgia Tech, the University of Alabama, Auburn, the University of Georgia, Vanderbilt, Emory, and the historically black colleges and universities like Morehouse, Spelman, and Xavier. And it&#8217;s also a sign of a reinvestment in local entrepreneurship &#8212; a decades-long campaign to turn Atlanta into the center of a hub-and-spoke network of startup cities that spans Miami to Atlanta, with stops in Birmingham, Nashville, New Orleans,<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>&#8220;Atlanta is what a next generation, global, post-Silicon Valley tech hub looks like. Our demographics are ten years ahead of the U.S.&#8217;s transformation into a majority minority society,&#8221; wrote Calhoun in an email. &#8220;With over 40% of the U.S. population in the Southeast, the greatest density of founders and executives of color, rafts of tech companies like AirBnB locating here, and our own legacy of top tech and talent, Atlanta sets the tone for what&#8217;s next. We have the growing, diverse population base all strong founders need to scale.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s still a lot of work to be done for the region to establish itself as one of the next engines of economic return for the venture capital and investment business, though.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Southeast is 24% of the US GDP, but only accounts for 7% of the venture investment,&#8221; noted Blake Patton, the founder and general partner of the Atlanta-based investment firm, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techsquareventures.com\/\">Tech Square Ventures<\/a>. &#8220;With the recent momentum in the region, that is changing and investors are taking notice and backing local managers who in turn are investing the region\u2019s best and brightest entrepreneurs.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h2>The Internet boom and bust in Atlanta<\/h2>\n<p>In the years after the 1996 Olympics, Atlanta was a high-flying contender for the title of one of the next big startup hubs in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>The Olympics had put the city on the world&#8217;s stage, and seeing the wave of activity, excitement, and investment that came with the advent of internet companies like Virginia&#8217;s America Online, Atlanta&#8217;s city council and mayor were making a push for the city to become a telecom and startup hub in the early days of the first Internet boom.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Something happened in the mid-90s driven by the Olympics where Atlanta hit the map worldwide. It wasn\u2019t just that we were a supply and logistics hub. In the late 90s as the dot-com boom really evolved, things happened underground that aren\u2019t as transparent as they should be. Atlanta Gas Light had the largest dark fiber ring in the country surrounding Atlanta. That was built solely with the olympics in mind. We had Georgia Tech working on the next generation of aerospace, and they added computer engineering,&#8221; said Christy Brown, the founder of the Atlanta based non-profit <a href=\"https:\/\/launchpad2x.org\/\">Launchpad2X<\/a> and a serial entrepreneur and executive with deep ties to the Atlanta ecosystem.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Atlanta also had its fair share of early successes &#8212; high flying telecom and networking companies that were critical to the evolution of the first dot com era whose later years were either mired in scandal or who were acquired by much larger entities. These are companies like MCI Worldcom and Airtouch Cellular, which was gobbled up by Singular Wireless and would eventually become part of a restructured AT&amp;T.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;There were all kinds of tech things happening in the city. A lot of these founders were getting venture on paper which evolved into the dot-bomb,&#8221; said Brown. &#8220;All of this was happening mid to late nineties, when the dot-bomb happened there was a lot of failure in the Atlanta area.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The implosion of early internet companies that came with the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 reverberated through Atlanta&#8217;s tech ecosystem, erasing the early gains that companies made and setting the stage for a decade-long period of reconstruction punctuated by a few successes from holdouts that managed to make their way through the wreckage.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1096631\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1096631\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1096631\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg 1735w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=150,48 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=300,95 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=768,244 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=680,216 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=1536,489 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=50,16 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1096631\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Through the lean years<\/h2>\n<p>One of those companies was <a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/\">MailChimp<\/a>. Launched in 2001, in the early aftermath of the bursting of the tech bubble, the privately held email marketing startup was one of a number of projects at Ben Chestnut&#8217;s and Dan Kurzius&#8217; web development firm.<\/p>\n<p>The two men met at Cox Interactive Media to work on an early MP3 product. When that fizzled both men eventually lost their jobs and went into business together. They built MailChimp off of revenue, bootstrapping the business without venture capital in a model that many other tech founders in the area would seek to replicate.<\/p>\n<p>A few years later, in 2003, another entrepreneur named John Marshall began installing internet hotspots at hospitality businesses, eventually expanding his <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AirWatch\">Wandering WiFi<\/a> service to include monitoring and managing other kinds of network infrastructure. This foray into startup land would eventually create another big Atlanta tech exit in AirWatch.<\/p>\n<p>For the first six years MailChimp remained a side hustle, a product that the two co-founders continued to work on, but didn&#8217;t devote themselves to full time. It wasn&#8217;t until 2007, when the service hit 10,000 users, that the company became the full-time job for both founders.<\/p>\n<p>Their once-scrappy startup turned them into billionaires. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/alexkonrad\/2018\/10\/08\/the-new-atlanta-billionaires-behind-an-unlikely-tech-unicorn\/?sh=31a55a7331a2\">A 2018 Forbes profile<\/a> put the company&#8217;s valuation at $4.2 billion on roughly $600 million in revenue.<\/p>\n<p>If there was a starting gun for the Atlanta tech renaissance, it might be 2006, a few years before the global financial crisis and a time when the broader tech industry was finding itself a less financially precarious prospect for investors. Internet Security Systems, an Atlanta area dot-com darling that <a href=\"http:\/\/www.internetnews.com\/bus-news\/article.php\/56921\/Security+Stock+IPO+Sizzles+ISS+Group+Jumps+70+Since+Offer.htm\">held an initial public offering in the late 90s<\/a> sold to IBM for $1.3 billion that year.<\/p>\n<p>Tom Noonan and Chris Klaus, the co-founders at Internet Security Systems, had an equally long road. What had started out as a company built when Klaus <a href=\"https:\/\/www.networkworld.com\/article\/2208086\/life-after-ibm-is-all-green-for-iss-co-founder-tom-noonan.html\">lived above Noonan&#8217;s garage in Atlanta in the mid-90s<\/a>, morphed into a company pulling in $400 million in annual revenue before its acquisition by IBM.<\/p>\n<p>As capital started flowing into Atlanta and the city regained some of its footing in the tech world, founders who had exited their companies began to reinvest money locally. And the city moved to create more events to foster entrepreneurship. 2006 saw the launch of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ventureatlanta.org\/\">Venture Atlanta<\/a>, a conference designed to showcase early talent and startups coming from the region that served as a launchpad for several entrepreneurs that would shape the future of the city&#8217;s technology industry.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1096631\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1096631\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1096631\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg 1735w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=150,48 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=300,95 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=768,244 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=680,216 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=1536,489 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=50,16 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1096631\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Setting a new scene<\/h2>\n<p>If 2006 was a big year for exits in Atlanta, it also proved to be the year that opened the floodgates on new entrepreneurial activity, which would give rise over the next decade to what&#8217;s now a thriving startup scene, pumping out a record number of billion dollar tech businesses.<\/p>\n<p>It was the year that David Cummings and Adam Blitzer <a href=\"https:\/\/www.salesforceben.com\/the-drip\/a-brief-history-of-salesforce-marketing-cloud-and-pardot\/\">founded Pardot<\/a>, a marketing and sales automation software developer that grew quickly and attracted the attention of big industry players like ExactTarget.

Hit hard by the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the Atlanta-area firms that managed to survive the crash began to look to later stage businesses and outside of the Atlanta tech ecosystem for startups to back, according to data from CrunchBase and several interviews with investors and founders.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/noromoseley.com\/\">Noro-Moseley Partners<\/a>, for instance, is by far the most active investor hailing from Atlanta. Over it&#8217;s long history the firm has done over 123 deals according to Crunchbase, but in the last five years, data indicates only four investment from the firm were made into Atlanta-based companies.<\/p>\n<p>By contrast, the arrivistes at BIP have been deploying capital and raising successively larger funds since they first came to town. Over the last five years the firm has invested in at least 15 Atlanta-area deals, and now, under the moniker of <a href=\"https:\/\/panoramic.vc\/\">Panoramic Ventures<\/a>, the firm is targeting a $300 million early stage fund to invest across the southeast and midwest.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Traditionally, access to capital was challenging for founders in Atlanta and the Southeast. In the past, it was considered a disadvantage for a tech business to be based outside of the traditional innovation hubs [in] Silicon Valley or the Northeast because it was more difficult to secure investment capital. This was because the large funds were located inside the hubs and had plenty of opportunities right on their doorsteps for investment,&#8221; wrote Mark Buffington, the co-founder and chief executive of BIP Capital, in an email to TechCrunch. &#8220;While the traditional hubs are still key in terms of aggregate capital, the requirement for startups to also be inside the hubs has changed. Increasingly, venture funds are locating themselves in other areas of the country where innovation is occurring. At the same time, the amount of capital available from local and regional investors is growing, in large part due to the influx of dollars into the private markets.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another member of the new school of investors that&#8217;s changing Atlanta&#8217;s investment scene is Patton; whose work with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techsquareventures.com\/\">Tech Square Ventures<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.engage.vc\/\">Engage<\/a>, the corporate venture capital investment firm and startup initiative harnessing the power of a number of the biggest companies in Atlanta, also galvanized entrepreneurship and the newfound interest in startup tech companies.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The recent momentum in the region is driven by increased connectivity across the innovation ecosystem and a critical mass of entrepreneurs and talent coming out of the region&#8217;s many successful startups. With corporations focused on digital transformation and innovation, all large companies have to a degree become tech companies and that drives connectivity as talent moves across both startups and tech companies,&#8221; Patton said. &#8220;Perhaps our greatest strength is our diversity and being home to four leading HBCUs, and I hope in the next 5 years the Southeast will emerge as a leader in producing successful startups founded by diverse entrepreneurs and built with diverse teams. It\u2019s not just a moral imperative &#8211; with half the nation\u2019s black population, the Southeast must succeed in engaging under-served entrepreneurs to lead \u2013 and you can\u2019t tackle diversity nationally without tackling it in the Southeast.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Still, other ingredients were needed for the resurgence of startup activity in the city. These would be co-workings spaces like David Cummings&#8217; launch of the <a href=\"https:\/\/atlantatechvillage.com\/\">Atlanta Tech Village<\/a> in 2012; the continuing relevance of the<a href=\"https:\/\/atdc.org\/\"> Atlanta Tech Development Center<\/a>; the Venture Atlanta conference and the co-working space around <a href=\"https:\/\/hypepotamus.com\/\">Hypepotamus<\/a> &#8212; which remains the go-to publication for Southern startup activity.<\/p>\n<p>Every entrepreneur and investor mentioned Cummings&#8217; decision to reinvest in the city and launch the Tech Village near Atlanta&#8217;s tony suburb of Buckhead as one of the biggest sparks for the city&#8217;s renewed entrepreneurial fervor. Soon after Cummings sold Pardot he and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/davidlightburn\/\">David Lightburn<\/a> established Atlanta Tech Village as a co-working spot for entrepreneurs. It attracted a number of new startup founders whose businesses would become the next wave of big startups. &#8220;<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When David Cummings sold Pardot he wanted a place for entrepreneurs to have community,&#8221; said one longtime player in the Atlanta tech community. &#8220;They would do these startup chow down lunches and really support entrepreneurs building businesses.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>And just as key was the longtime hub for Georgia Tech-affiliated startups, the Atlanta Tech Development Center, the entrepreneurs and investors noted.

Together with <a href=\"https:\/\/create-x.gatech.edu\/\">CreateX<\/a>, and the Venture Atlanta program, the four initiatives and workspaces for early stage entrepreneurs planted a number of seeds that would soon blossom into companies like PartPic, Greenlight Financial (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/27\/kids-focused-fintech-greenlight-raises-260m-in-a16z-led-series-d-nearly-doubles-valuation-to-2-3b\/\">which is now worth $2.3 billion<\/a>), Kabbage, FullStory and Pindrop.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1096631\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1096631\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1096631\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"326\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg 1735w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=150,48 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=300,95 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=768,244 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=680,216 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=1536,489 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/12\/atlanta-background.jpg?resize=50,16 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1096631\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TechCrunch<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>A haven for diverse founders and investors<\/h2>\n<p>During those early days of the Atlanta startup ecosystem, there was one spot more welcoming than most for diverse and women-led founders &#8212; the co-working space and offices for Hypepotamus.<\/p>\n<p>Serial entrepreneur Monique Mills was there.

Then when I raised some money the next major one was at ATDC &#8212; the state of Georgia\u2019s incubator. They offered subsidized space and they had an entrepreneur in residence and they had a whole program to help Atlanta-based startups with some kind of technology.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It was the Hypepotamus space, and subsequent venues like Opportunity Hub and The Gathering Spot that catalyzed the Black entrepreneurial community in Atlanta, according to several founders and investors.<\/p>\n<p>And if the Hypepotamus space, carved out by National Builder Supply, was one of the catalysts, then the angel investor, Mike Ross, was the other.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Mike has funded many successful Black-led startups in the Atlanta ecosystem and we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today without him,&#8221; entrepreneur Candace Mitchell Harris <a href=\"https:\/\/urbangeekz.com\/2021\/02\/meet-the-investor-behind-atlantas-most-successful-black-led-tech-startups\/\">told UrbanGeekz<\/a> in a recent profile. &#8220;When many have faced the run around of false promises or flat out rejections, Mike confidently put his money in and pushed our founders further.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Ross, a\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.morehouse.edu\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Morehouse College alumnus<\/a>, who made his wealth as a consultant in the construction and contracting industry has backed Black founders and investors including: Luma, Partpic, Monsieur,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/urbangeekz.com\/2020\/09\/the-first-ever-hbcu-esports-league-kicks-off-in-atlanta\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Axis Replay<\/a>, Myavana,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/urbangeekz.com\/2019\/04\/atlanta-startup-battle-6-0-crowns-two-winners-for-six-figure-investments\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">TechSquare Labs<\/a>,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/urbangeekz.com\/2015\/02\/business-incubator-targets-minority-owned-startups\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Opportunity Hub<\/a>, and\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/urbangeekz.com\/2019\/08\/atlantas-black-tech-startup-ecosystem-is-gaining-momentum\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Gathering Spot<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Investors like Paul Judge and entrepreneurs like Joey Womack, Barry Givens, and Mitchell Harris, all benefited from Ross&#8217; investment largesse.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMike was the catalyst for our company\u2019s success as our very first angel investor,\u201d says Mitchell Harris, co-founder and CEO of beauty tech startup\u00a0Myavana,<a href=\"https:\/\/urbangeekz.com\/2021\/02\/meet-the-investor-behind-atlantas-most-successful-black-led-tech-startups\/\"> told UrbanGeekz<\/a>. \u201cI still remember meeting him for the first time at the Black Founders Conference in June 2012, inquisitive and eager to get behind the movement that was beginning in Atlanta in the tech startup scene.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>And Ross blazed a trail for other investors like the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fearless.fund\/team\">Fearless Fund<\/a>, a group of women investors led by Arian Simone, Ayanna Parsons, and Keshia Knight Pulliam, who launched their first fund in 2019, and Collab Capital, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/09\/collab-capital-launches-with-a-50-million-target-and-a-mission-to-help-black-entrepreneurs\/\">which launched last year<\/a> (and is led by Burks Solomon, Justin Dawkins, and Barry Givens) &#8212; close to a decade after Ross first began investing.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6bQa3Xvu02\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/09\/collab-capital-launches-with-a-50-million-target-and-a-mission-to-help-black-entrepreneurs\/\">Collab Capital launches with a $50 million target and a mission to help Black entrepreneurs<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Collab Capital launches with a $50 million target and a mission to help Black entrepreneurs&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/06\/09\/collab-capital-launches-with-a-50-million-target-and-a-mission-to-help-black-entrepreneurs\/embed\/#?secret=6bQa3Xvu02\" data-secret=\"6bQa3Xvu02\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;Right now women of color are the most founded but the least funded entrepreneurs,&#8221; Simone said. &#8220;<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Atlanta is a mecca of black entrepreneurship for us to have a venture capital and tech presence here.. I will charge the city of Atlanta and the state of Georgia and the banks that they need to back what we\u2019re doing here.. It is needed.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Not only is it needed, but it&#8217;s working. Of the 36 venture capital firms identified as part of TechCrunch&#8217;s research as having a focus on early stage investments in the Atlanta area, 41% met one or more of the following criteria: identification as having a diversity focus across investments, identification as having a diverse fund management team, or both, according to data from Crunchbase.<\/p>\n<p>And through a sample size of 158 startups spanning Pre-Seed, Seed, or Series A in the Atlanta area, which were included in TechCrunch&#8217;s research, 48% met one or more of the following criteria: identification as having a sex-diverse founding team, identification has having a racially-diverse founding team, or both. In many instances, founding teams did not self identify, so the number of diverse founders may be greater than currently documented based on publicly available data.<\/p>\n<p>As UrbanGeekz noted, about 25% of the employees in Atlanta&#8217;s tech industry are black. In San Francisco, by contrast, that figure is 6%.<\/p>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewSubmissionDate\">\n<p>&#8220;Ten years ago [the Black tech startup ecosystem] was just starting out,&#8221; Ross told UrbanGeekz. &#8220;Now Atlanta is one of the top tech hubs in the country and the ecosystem is probably one of the most diverse.&#8221;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"freebirdFormviewerViewSubmissionDate\">\n<h2>Looking ahead<\/h2>\n<p>&#8220;I\u2019m really excited about what\u2019s happening now. It\u2019s much more diverse in terms of the people that have the ability to deploy capital. I\u2019m optimistic about what is to come in the tech space,&#8221; said Burks Solomon.<\/p>\n<p>She&#8217;s not alone. New firms like Cohn and O&#8217;Brien&#8217;s Overline Ventures, Panoramic, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.outlanderlabs.com\/\">Outlander Labs<\/a>, the firm launched by the former Los Angeles investors Paige and Leura Craig are all signs of investors&#8217; long-term belief in the health of the Atlanta startup ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We think that the Southeast and especially Atlanta has the opportunity to become a key hub for tech startups in the next 5 years. It feels a lot like Los Angeles five years ago. The talent is here but historically the issue has been lack of mentorship, early stage capital, and the later stage capital as they grow and scale,&#8221; wrote Outlander co-founder Leura Craig, in an email. &#8220;However that is all changing given the fact that so many investors are now moving to all parts of the country and are open to investing in areas that they never invested in before. Covid dramatically accelerated the flight from California and New York and the Southeast&#8217;s tech scene is going to be a huge winner as a result of this migration. &#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Major tech companies are also showing their faith in Atlanta&#8217;s startup scene through significant investments into the ecosystem. Most recently, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/13\/apple-announces-new-projects-related-to-its-100-million-pledge-for-racial-equity-and-justice\/\">Apple has committed nearly $100 million to new projects including the Propel Center,<\/a> a $25 million bid designed to encourage diversity and entrepreneurship at a site to be built near Atlanta&#8217;s Historically Black Colleges and Universities.<\/p>\n<p>It is going to be both a virtual platform and a physical campus in the Atlanta University Center.<\/p>\n<p>Students will be able to follow different educational tracks focused on artificial intelligence, agricultural technologies, social justice, entertainment, app development, augmented reality, design and creative arts and entrepreneurship. This isn\u2019t just a monetary investment for Apple, as employees will help develop curricula and provide mentorship as well. There will be internship opportunities for students.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"ZXso3RPJgA\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/13\/apple-announces-new-projects-related-to-its-100-million-pledge-for-racial-equity-and-justice\/\">Apple announces new projects related to its $100 million pledge for racial equity and justice<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple announces new projects related to its $100 million pledge for racial equity and justice&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/13\/apple-announces-new-projects-related-to-its-100-million-pledge-for-racial-equity-and-justice\/embed\/#?secret=ZXso3RPJgA\" data-secret=\"ZXso3RPJgA\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Apple isn&#8217;t the only big tech company to commit to Atlanta&#8217;s thriving tech community.

From marketing and logistics to finance and product, decision-making is now dominated by data at all levels of most big private orgs (and if it isn\u2019t, I\u2019d be getting a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 put together, stat).<\/p>\n<p>So it might be a something of a surprise to learn that data, which could transform how we respond to the increasingly deadly disasters that regularly plague us, has been all but absent from much of emergency response this past decade. Far from being a geyser of digital oil, disaster response agencies and private organizations alike have for years tried to swell the scope and scale of the data being inputted into disaster response, with relatively meager results.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s starting to change though, mostly thanks to the internet of things (IoT), and frontline crisis managers today increasingly have the data they need to make better decisions across the resilience, response, and recovery cycle. The best is yet to come \u2014 with drones flying up, simulated visualizations, and artificial intelligence-induced disasters \u2014 what we\u2019re seeing today on the frontlines is only the beginning of what could be a revolution in disaster response in the 2020s.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<h2 id=\"The long-awaited disaster data deluge has finally arrived\">The long-awaited disaster data deluge has finally arrived<\/h2>\n<p>Emergency response is a fight against the fog of war and the dreadful ticking of the clock. In the midst of a wildfire or hurricane, everything can change in a matter of seconds \u2014 even milliseconds if you aren\u2019t paying attention. Safe roads ferrying evacuees can suddenly become impassable infernos, evacuation teams can reposition and find themselves spread far too thin, and unforeseen conditions can rapidly metastasize to cover the entire operating environment. An operations center that once had perfect information can quickly find it has no ground truth at all.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, even getting raw data on what\u2019s happening before and during a disaster can be extraordinarily difficult. When we look at the data revolution in business, part of the early success stems from the fact that companies were always heavily reliant on data to handle their activities. Digitalization was and is the key word: moving from paper to computers in order to transform latent raw data into a form that was machine-readable and therefore analyzable. In business, the last ten years was basically upgrading to version two from version one.<\/p>\n<p>In emergency management however, many agencies are stuck without a version at all. Take a flood \u2014 where is the water and where is it going? Up until recently, there was no comprehensive data on where waters rose from and where they sloshed to. When it came to wildfires, there were no administrative datasets on where every tree in the world was located and how prone each is to fire. Even human infrastructure like power lines and cell towers often had little interface with the digital world. They stood there, and if you couldn\u2019t see them, they couldn\u2019t see you.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2146559\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2146559\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2146559\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg 3900w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1229551957.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2146559\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Flood modeling is on the cutting edge of disaster planning and response.

Temperature, atmospheric pressure, water levels, humidity, pollution, power, and other sensors have been widely deployed, emitting constant streams of data back into data warehouses ready for analysis.<\/p>\n<p>Take wildfires in the American West. It wasn\u2019t all that long ago that the U.S. federal government and state firefighting agencies had no knowledge of where a blaze was taking place. Firefighting has been \u201c100 years of tradition unimpeded by progress,\u201d Tom Harbour, head of fire response for a decade at the U.S. Forest Service and now chief fire officer at <a href=\"https:\/\/cornea.is\">Cornea<\/a> put it.<\/p>\n<p>And he\u2019s right. After all, firefighting is a visceral activity \u2014 responders can see the fires, even feel the burning heat echoing off of their flesh. Data wasn\u2019t useful, particularly in the West where there are millions of acres of land and large swaths are sparsely populated. Massive conflagrations could be detected by satellites, but smoldering fires in the brush would be entirely invisible to the geospatial authorities. There\u2019s smoke over California \u2014 exactly what is a firefighter on the ground supposed to do with such valuable information?<\/p>\n<p>Today after a decade of speculative promise, IoT sensors are starting to clear a huge part of this fog. Aaron Clark-Ginsberg, a social scientist at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.rand.org\">RAND Corporation<\/a> who researches community resilience, said that air quality sensors have become ubiquitous since they are \u201cvery cheap [and] pretty easy to use\u201d and can offer very fine-grained understandings of pollution \u2014 a key signal, for instance, of wildfires. He pointed to the company <a href=\"https:\/\/www2.purpleair.com\">Purple Air<\/a>, which in addition to making sensors, also produces a popular consumer map of air quality, as indicative of the potential these days for technology.<\/p>\n<p>Maps are the critical intersection for data in disasters. Geospatial information systems (GIS) form the basis for most planning and response teams, and no company has a larger footprint in the sector than privately-held <a href=\"https:\/\/www.esri.com\/en-us\/home\">Esri<\/a>. Ryan Lanclos, who leads public safety solutions at the company, pointed to the huge expansion of water sensors as radically changing responses to certain disasters. \u201cFlood sensors are always pulsing,\u201c he said, and with a \u201cnational water model coming out of the federal government ,\u201d researchers can now predict through GIS analysis how a flood will affect different communities with a precision unheard of previously.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2146560\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2146560\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2146560\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"428\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg 3000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=150,94 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=300,189 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=768,483 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=680,428 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=1536,967 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=2048,1289 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1063020952.jpg?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2146560\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Digital maps and GIS systems are increasingly vital for disaster planning and response, but paper still remains quite ubiquitous. Image Credits: Paul Kitagaki Jr.-Pool\/Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Cory Davis, the director of public safety strategy and crisis response at Verizon (which, through our parent company Verizon Media, is TechCrunch\u2019s ultimate owner), said that all of these sensors have transformed how crews work to maintain infrastructure as well. \u201cThink like a utility that is able to put a sensor on a power line \u2014 now they have sensors and get out there quicker, resolve it, and get the power back up.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He noted one major development that has transformed sensors in this space the last few years: battery life. Thanks to continuous improvements in ultra-low-power wireless chips as well as better batteries and energy management systems, sensors can last a <i>really<\/i> long time in the wilderness without the need for maintenance. \u201cNow we have devices that have ten-year battery lives,\u201d he said. That\u2019s critical, because it can be impossible to connect these sensors to the power grid in frontier areas.<\/p>\n<p>The same line of thinking holds true at T-Mobile as well. When it comes to preventative planning, Jay Naillon, senior director of national technology service operations strategy at the telco, said that \u201cthe type of data that is becoming more and more valuable for us is the storm surge data \u2014 it can make it easier to know we have the right assets in place.\u201d That data comes from flood sensors that can offer real-time warnings signals to planners across the country.<\/p>\n<p>Telecom interest \u2014 and commercial interest in general \u2014 has been critical to accelerating the adoption of sensors and other data streams around disasters. While governments may be the logical end user of flood or wildfire data, they aren\u2019t the only ones interested in this visibility. \u201cA lot of consumers of that information are in the private sector,\u201d said Jonathan Sury, project director at the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at the Earth Institute at Columbia University. \u201cThese new types of risks, like climate change, are going to affect their bottom lines,\u201d and he pointed to bond ratings, insurance underwriting and other areas where commercial interest in sensor data has been profound.<\/p>\n<p>Sensors may not literally be ubiquitous, but they have offered a window into the ambiguity that emergency managers have never had visibility into before.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, there is the extensive datasets around mobile usage that have become ubiquitous throughout much of the world. <a href=\"https:\/\/dataforgood.fb.com\">Facebook\u2019s Data for Good project<\/a>, for instance, provides data layers around connectivity \u2014 are users connecting from one place and then later connecting from a different location, indicating displacement? That sort of data from the company and telcos themselves can help emergency planners scout out how populations are shifting in real-time.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"Data, data, on the wall \u2014 how many AIs can they call?\">Data, data, on the wall \u2014 how many AIs can they call?<\/h2>\n<p>Rivulets of data have now turned into floods of information, but just like floodwaters rising in cities across the world, the data deluge now needs a response all its own. In business, the surfeit of big data has been wrangled with an IT stack from data warehouses all the way to business intelligence tools.<\/p>\n<p>If only data for disasters could be processed so easily. Data relevant for disasters is held by dozens of different organizations spanning the private, public, and non-profit sectors, leading to huge interoperability problems. Even when the data can be harmonized, there are large challenges in summarizing the findings down to an actual decision a frontline responder can use in their work \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/01\/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world\/\">making AI a tough sale still today<\/a>, particularly outside of planning. As Davis of Verizon put it, \u201cnow that they have this plethora of data, a lot of cities and federal agencies are struggling with how to use it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, standardization is a challenge at all scales. Globally, countries mostly lack interoperability, although standards are improving over time. Amir Elichai, the founder and CEO of 911 call-handling platform <a href=\"https:\/\/carbyne911.com\">Carbyne<\/a>, said that \u201cfrom a technology standpoint and a standards standpoint, there is a big difference between countries,\u201d noting that protocols from one country often have to be completely rewritten to serve a different market.<\/p>\n<p>Tom Cotter, director of emergency response and preparedness at health care disaster response organization <a href=\"https:\/\/www.projecthope.org\">Project HOPE<\/a>, said that even setting up communications between responders can be challenging in an international environment. \u201cSome countries allow certain platforms but not others, and it is constantly changing,\u201d he said. \u201cI basically have every single technology communication platform you can possibly have in one place.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>One senior federal emergency management official acknowledged that data portability has become increasingly key in procurement contracts for technology, with the government recognizing the need to buy commercially-available software rather than custom-designed software. That message has been picked up by companies like Esri, with Lanclos stating that \u201cpart of our core mission is to be open and \u2026 create data and to share that openly to the public or securely through open standards.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For all its downsides though, the lack of interoperability can be ironically helpful for innovation. Elichai said that the \u201clack of standards is an advantage \u2014 you are not buying into a legacy standard,\u201d and in some contexts where standards are lacking, quality protocols can be built with the assumption of a modern data workflow.<\/p>\n<p>Even with interoperability though, the next challenge becomes data sanitation \u2014 and disaster data is dirty as \u2026 well, something. While sensor streams can be verified and cross-checked with other datasets, in recent years there has been a heavy increase in the quantity of citizen-submitted information that has to be carefully vetted before it is disseminated to first responders or the public.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2146561\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2146561\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2146561\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg 5429w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=150,102 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=300,205 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=768,525 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=680,465 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=1536,1049 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=2048,1399 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-465694096.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2146561\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">With citizens having more access to smartphones than ever, emergency planners have to sanitize uploaded data uploaded in order to verify and make it useful.

Raj Kamachee, the CIO of <a href=\"https:\/\/teamrubiconusa.org\">Team Rubicon<\/a>, a non-profit which assembles teams of volunteer military veterans to respond to natural disasters, said that verification is critical, and it\u2019s a key element of the infrastructure he has built at the organization since joining in 2017. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten more people using it so more feedback [and] more data [is] coming through the pipes,\u201d he said. \u201cSo creating a self-service, a very collaborative approach.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>With quality and quantity, the AI models should come, right? Well, yes and no.<\/p>\n<p>Sury of Columbia wants to cool down at least some of the hype around AI. \u201cThe big caveat with all of these machine learning and big data applications is that they are not a panacea \u2014 they are able to process a lot of disparate information, [but] they\u2019re certainly not going to tell us exactly what to do,\u201d he said. \u201cFirst responders are already processing a lot of information,\u201d and they don\u2019t necessarily need more guidance.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, AI in disasters is increasingly focused on planning and resilience. Sury pointed to <a href=\"https:\/\/oneconcern.com\/en\/\">OneConcern<\/a>, a resiliency planning platform, as one example of how data and AI can be combined in the disaster planning process. He also pointed to the CDC\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.atsdr.cdc.gov\/placeandhealth\/svi\/index.html\">Social Vulnerability Index<\/a> and risk tools from FEMA that integrate different data signals into scalar values by emergency planners to optimize their contingency plans.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, almost everyone I talked to was much more hesitant about the power of AI. As I discussed a bit <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/01\/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world\/\">in part one of this series regarding the disaster sales cycle<\/a>, data tools have to be real-time and perfect every time given the lives that are on the line. Kamachee of Team Rubicon noted that when choosing tools, he avoids whiz-bang and instead looks at the pure utility of individual vendors. \u201cWe go high tech, but we prepare for low tech,\u201d he said, empathizing that in disaster response, everything must be agile and adaptable to changing circumstances.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"Kgw9OtLdmO\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/01\/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world\/\">The most disastrous sales cycle in the world<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;The most disastrous sales cycle in the world&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/01\/the-most-disastrous-sales-cycle-in-the-world\/embed\/#?secret=Kgw9OtLdmO\" data-secret=\"Kgw9OtLdmO\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Elichai of Carbyne saw this pattern in his sales. There\u2019s a \u201csensitivity in our market and the reluctance from time to time to adopt\u201d new technologies he said, but acknowledged that \u201cthere is no doubt that AI at a certain point will provide benefits.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Naillon of T-Mobile had similar views from the operator perspective, saying that \u201cI can\u2019t say that we really leverage AI very much\u201d in the company\u2019s disaster planning. Instead of AI as brain, the telecom company simply uses data and forecast modeling to optimally position equipment \u2014 no fancy GANs required.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of planning, AI has helped in post-disaster recovery, and specifically around damage assessments. After a crisis transpires, assessments of infrastructure and private property have to be made in order for insurance claims to be filed and for a community to move forward. Art delaCruz, COO and president of Team Rubicon, noted that technology and a flourish of AI has helped significantly around damage assessments. Since his organization often helps rebuild communities in the course of its work, triaging damage is a critical element of its effective response strategy.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"There\u2019s a brighter future, other than that brightness from the sun that is going to burn us to a crisp, right?\">There\u2019s a brighter future, other than that brightness from the sun that is going to burn us to a crisp, right?<\/h2>\n<p>So AI today is helping a bit with resilience planning and disaster recovery and not so much during emergency response itself, but there is certainly more to come across the entire cycle. Indeed, there is a lot of excitement about the future of drones, which are increasingly being used in the field, but there are concerns long term about whether AI and data will ultimately cause more problems than they solve.<\/p>\n<p>Drones would seem to have an obvious value for disaster response, and indeed, they have been used by teams to get additional aerial footage and context where direct access by responders is limited. Kamachee of Team Rubicon noted that in the Bahamas on a mission, response teams used drones to detect survivors, since major roads were blocked. The drones snapped images that were processed using AI, and helped the team to identify those survivors for evacuation. He described drones and their potential as \u201csexy; very, very cool.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2146562\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2146562\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2146562\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"448\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg 5517w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=300,197 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=768,505 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=1536,1011 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=2048,1348 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1279579605.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2146562\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Aerial views from drones can give disaster response teams much better real-time information, particularly in areas where on-the-ground access is limited.

Hana is the co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"http:\/\/MagicBell.com\">MagicBell<\/a>, a new startup she created with Josue Montano that just recently graduated from Y Combinator&#8217;s Winter 2021 cohort. MagicBell is a full-featured, plug-and-play notifications inbox aimed at developers who want to build one into their own product, but don&#8217;t want to have to build one themselves from scratch.<\/p>\n<p>Hana&#8217;s experience as an entrepreneur spans multiple companies, including her last one which she grew to significant success in terms of annual revenue. She&#8217;s also a proud transgender woman, who underwent her transition mid-way through her existing history as a founder and entrepreneur. Hana talks to us about the challenges she faced taking on her transition in an industry where the focus is often exclusively on how hard you&#8217;re hustling and what you&#8217;re building next, and about her origin story as a founder coming from an environment where there weren&#8217;t necessarily many examples with similar life experience to look to for inspiration.<\/p>\n<p>During our chat, Hana also shared lots of insight into YC, and what it provides founders, as well as perspective on what it was like going through the program during a global pandemic in a remote context. Finally, she offers some great context on finding your first investors and customers as a distributed team.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>We loved talking to Hana, and we hope you love the episode.

Today it\u2019s worth $252 and change. Alphabet traded down to around $1,070 per share. Today the search giant is worth $2,410 per share.<\/p>\n<p>The result of the huge share-price appreciation is that Apple is now worth $2.21 trillion, Microsoft $1.88 trillion, Amazon $1.76 trillion, Alphabet $1.60 trillion and Facebook $0.93 trillion. That\u2019s around $8.4 trillion for the five companies.<\/p>\n<p>Back in July of 2017, I <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/techs-5-biggest-players-now-worth-3-trillion\/\">wrote a piece<\/a> noting that their aggregate value had reached the $3 trillion mark. That became <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/the-big-5-worth-4-trillion-heading-into-earnings\/\">$4 trillion in mid-2018<\/a>. And then in the next three years or so it more than doubled again.<\/p>\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/MylesUdland\">Myles Udland<\/a>, a reporter at our sister publication Yahoo Finance, has at least part of the puzzle in <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/earnings-are-beating-expectations-at-a-record-rate-morning-brief-100229838.html\">a piece he wrote this week<\/a>. Here\u2019s Udland:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>And while it seems that almost every earnings story has sort of followed this same arc, data also confirms that this is not just our imagination: corporate earnings have never been this far out of line with expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Data out of the team at Refinitiv published Thursday showed the rate at which companies were beating estimates and the magnitude by which they were beating expectations through Thursday morning&#8217;s results were the best on record.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>So earnings are beating the street\u2019s guesses more frequently, and at a higher differential, than ever? That makes recent stock-market appreciation less worrisome, I suppose. And it helps explain why startups have been able to raise so much capital lately <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/14\/inside-the-us-epic-first-quarter-venture-capital-results\/\">in the United States<\/a>, as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/19\/european-vc-soars-in-q1\/\">they have in Europe<\/a>, and why private-market investors are pouring so much capital <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/29\/fintech-startups-set-vc-records-as-the-2021-fundraising-market-continues-to-impress\/\">into fintech startups<\/a>. And it\u2019s probably why <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/28\/zomato-juice-indian-unicorns-proposed-ipo-could-drive-regional-startup-liquidity\/\">Zomato is going public<\/a> and why we\u2019re <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/30\/optimism-reigns-at-consumer-trading-services-as-fintech-vc-spikes-and-robinhood-ipo-looms\/\">still waiting for the Robinhood debut<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This is what a market feels like when the underlying businesses are firing on all cylinders, it appears. Just don\u2019t forget that no business cycle is unending, and no boom is forever.<\/p>\n<h2>An insurtech interlude<\/h2>\n<p>Extending The Exchange\u2019s recent reporting regarding fintech funding, and our <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money\/\">roundup from last week of insurtech startup rounds<\/a>, a few more notes on the latter startup niche, which can be broadly viewed as part of the larger financial technology world.<\/p>\n<p>This time we\u2019ll hear from <a href=\"https:\/\/accel.com\/people\/john-locke\">Accel\u2019s John Locke<\/a> regarding his investments in The Zebra &#8212; which recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/austins-newest-unicorn-insurtech-the-zebra-raises-150m-after-doubling-revenue-in-2020\/\">raised even more capital<\/a> &#8212; and the insurtech space more broadly.<\/p>\n<p>Asked why insurtech marketplaces like The Zebra have been able to raise so very much money in the last year, Locke said that it\u2019s a mix of \u201cinsurance carriers [&#8230;] finally embracing marketplaces and willing to design integrated consumer experiences with marketplaces,\u201d along with more consumer \u201ccomparison shopping\u201d and, finally, growth and revenue quality.<\/p>\n<p>The Zebra, Locke said, is \u201cstill growing north of 100% at ~$120M+ revenue run-rate.\u201d That means it can go public whenever it wants.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"6Ig0DxvFvM\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money\/\">Insurtech startups are leveraging rapid growth to raise big money<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Insurtech startups are leveraging rapid growth to raise big money&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/20\/insurtech-startups-are-leveraging-rapid-growth-to-raise-big-money\/embed\/#?secret=6Ig0DxvFvM\" data-secret=\"6Ig0DxvFvM\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>But on that matter, there has been some weakness in the stock market for some public insurtech companies. Is Locke worried about that? He\u2019s neutral-to-positive, saying that his firm does not \u201cthink all the companies in the market will work but still thinks &#8216;insurtechs&#8217; will take market share from incumbents over the next decade.\u201d Fair enough.<\/p>\n<p>And Accel is still considering more deals in the space, as are others. Locke said that the venture market for insurtech investments is \u201cdefinitely more aggressive\u201d this year than last.<\/p>\n<h2>Various and sundry<\/h2>\n<p>Closing today, a few notes on things that we didn\u2019t get to that matter:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.productboard.com\/\">Productboard<\/a> closed a $72 million Series C. First, that\u2019s a huge round. Second, yes, Tiger did lead the deal. Third, the product management software company has around 4,000 customers today. That\u2019s a lot. Add this company to your two-years-from-now IPO list.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Chinese bike-sharing startup Hello is going public in the United States. We are going to get back to this on Monday, but its F-1 filing is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1841944\/000104746921001022\/a2243152zf-1.htm\">here<\/a>. The company turned $926.3 million worth of 2020 revenues into $109.6 million in gross profit, and a net loss of $173.7 million in net losses. Yowza.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.darktrace.com\/en\/\">Darktrace<\/a> went public this week. I know of it because it sponsors <a href=\"https:\/\/www.darktrace.com\/en\/mclaren\/\">an F1 team that I adore<\/a>, but it enters our world today as a recent U.K.-listed company. And after Deliveroo went kersplat, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/04\/30\/darktrace-ipo-dark-stock-skyrockets-43percent-in-london-debut.html\">resounding success<\/a> of the Darktrace listing could make the U.K. a more attractive place to list than it was a week ago.<\/li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">And, finally, drone delivery is, maybe, coming at last? U.K.-listed venture capital group Draper Esprit led the $25 million round into <a href=\"https:\/\/www.manna.aero\/\">Manna<\/a>, which wants to use unmanned drones in Ireland to deliver grub. \u201cManna sees a huge appetite for a greener, quieter, safer, and faster delivery service,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.uktech.news\/news\/london-vc-draper-esprit-invests-in-manna-20210429\">UKTN reports<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A long, weird week.

Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sat down with Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska for the first high-level bilateral summit of the new administration, it was not a typical diplomatic meeting. Instead of a polite but restrained diplomatic exchange, the two sides traded pointed barbs for almost two hours. \u201cThere is growing consensus that the era of engagement with China has come to an unceremonious close,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.foreignaffairs.com\/articles\/china\/competition-with-china-without-catastrophe\">wrote<\/a> Sullivan and Kurt Campbell, the Administration&#8217;s Asia czar also in attendance, back in 2019. How apt that they were present for that moment\u2019s arrival.<\/p>\n<p>A little more than one hundred days into the Biden Administration, there is no shortage of views on how it should handle this new era of Sino-American relations. From a blue-ribbon panel assembled by former Google Chairman Eric Schmidt to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.politico.com\/news\/magazine\/2021\/01\/28\/china-foreign-policy-long-telegram-anonymous-463120\">Politico essay from an anonymous former Trump Administration official<\/a> that consciously echoes (in both its name and its author\u2019s anonymity) George Kennan\u2019s famous \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/digitalarchive.wilsoncenter.org\/document\/116178.pdf\">Long Telegram<\/a>\u201d laying out the theory of Cold War containment, to countless think tank reports, it seems everyone is having their say.<\/p>\n<p>What is largely uncontroversial though is that technology is at the center of U.S.-China relations, and any competition with China will be won or lost in the digital and cyber spheres. \u201cPart of the goal of the Alaska meeting was to convince the Chinese that the Biden administration is determined to compete with Beijing across the board to offer competitive technology,\u201d <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2021\/03\/20\/us\/politics\/china-russia-biden.html\">wrote<\/a> David Sanger in the <i>New York Times <\/i>shortly afterward.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>But what, exactly, does a tech-centered China strategy look like? And what would it take for one to succeed?<\/p>\n<h2>Tech has brought Republicans and Democrats uneasily together<\/h2>\n<p>One encouraging sign is that China has emerged as one of the few issues on which even Democrats agree that President Trump had some valid points. \u201cTrump really was the spark that reframed the entire debate around U.S.-China relations in DC,\u201d says Jordan Schneider, a China analyst at the <a href=\"https:\/\/rhg.com\/\">Rhodium Group<\/a> and the host of the <a href=\"https:\/\/chinatalk.substack.com\/\">ChinaTalk podcast and newsletter<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While many in the foreign policy community favored some degree of cooperation with China before the Trump presidency, now competition \u2013 if not outright rivalry \u2013 is widely assumed. \u201cDemocrats, even those who served in the Obama Administration, have become much more hawkish,\u201d says Erik Brattberg of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

BROWN\/POOL\/AFP via Getty Images<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>As the U.S.-China rivalry has evolved, it has become more and more centered around competing philosophies on the use of technology. \u201cAt their core, democracies are open systems that believe in the free flow of information, whereas for autocrats, information is something to be weaponized and stifled in the service of the regime,\u201d says Lindsay Gorman, Fellow for Emerging Technologies at the German Marshall Fund. \u201cSo it\u2019s not too surprising that technology, so much of which is about how we store and process and leverage information, has become such a focus of the U.S.-China relationship and of the [broader] democratic-autocratic competition around the world.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Tech touches everything now \u2013 and the stakes could not be higher. \u201cTech and the business models around tech are really \u2018embedded ideology,\u2019&#8217; says Tyson Barker of the German Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cSo what tech is and how it is used is a form of governance.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What does that mean in practice? When Chinese firms expand around the world, Barker tells me, they bring their norms with them. So when Huawei builds a 5G network in Latin America, or Alipay is adopted for digital payments in Central Europe, or Xiaomi takes more market share in Southeast Asia, they are helping digitize those economies on Chinese terms using Chinese norms (as opposed to American ones). The implication is clear: whoever defines the future of technology will determine the rest of the twenty-first century.<\/p>\n<p>That shifting balance has focused minds in Washington.\u00a0\u201cI think there is a strong bipartisan consensus that technology is at the core of U.S.-China competition,\u201d says Brattberg. But, adds Gorman, \u201cthere\u2019s less agreement on what the prescription should be.\u201d While the Democratic experts now ascendant in Washington agree with Trump\u2019s diagnosis of the China challenge, they believe in a vastly different approach from their Trump Administration predecessors.<\/p>\n<p>Out, for instance, are restrictions on Chinese firms just for being Chinese. \u201cThat was one of the problems with Trump,\u201d says Walter Kerr, a former U.S. diplomat who publishes the <i>China Journal Review<\/i>. \u201cTrump cast broad strokes, targeting firms whether it was merited or not. Sticking it to the Chinese is not a good policy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Instead the focus is on inward investment \u2013\u00a0and outward cooperation.<\/p>\n<h2>Foreign policy is domestic policy<\/h2>\n<p>Democrats are first shoring up America domestically \u2013\u00a0in short, be strong at home to be strong abroad. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer a bright line between foreign and domestic policy,\u201d President Biden said in his first major foreign policy speech. \u201cEvery action we take in our conduct abroad, we must take with American working families in mind.

Those priorities have only become more important during the pandemic. It\u2019s a question of \u201chow do we orient the research system to fill in the industrial gaps that have been made very clear by the COVID crisis?\u201d says Schneider of Rhodium.<\/p>\n<p>While it hasn\u2019t gone so far as to adopt a national industrial strategy, the Administration\u2019s most ambitious officials are looking to prod along tech research in critical sectors. To that end, the National Security Council, which Sullivan runs, is reshaping itself around technology issues; Biden appointed the first deputy national security advisor focusing on technology issues as well as a high-profile senior director for technology. Their goal: to harness the same energy that drove the development of Silicon Valley during the Cold War into out-competing China.<\/p>\n<p>That said, the ingredients to American (and Western) innovation aren\u2019t exactly a secret: investment in education, research, and talent. \u201cThe West still has [most of] the universities, R&amp;D and leading companies,\u201d says Brattberg. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of competitiveness and leverage.\u201d Unsurprisingly, investing to retain that edge is a key theme of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2021\/03\/31\/upshot\/whats-in-bidens-infrastructure-plan.html\">Biden\u2019s $2 trillion infrastructure plan<\/a>, which includes funds for basic research, supply chain support, broadband connectivity, and support for the semiconductor industry.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vFq4rdDMse\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/31\/startups-have-about-1-trillion-worth-of-reasons-to-love-the-biden-infrastructure-plan\/\">Startups have about $1 trillion worth of reasons to love the Biden infrastructure plan<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Startups have about $1 trillion worth of reasons to love the Biden infrastructure plan&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/31\/startups-have-about-1-trillion-worth-of-reasons-to-love-the-biden-infrastructure-plan\/embed\/#?secret=vFq4rdDMse\" data-secret=\"vFq4rdDMse\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>As almost anyone in Silicon Valley will tell you, a functioning and welcoming immigration system is a crucial ingredient, too. \u201cThe U.S. is at its best when it welcomes talent from around the world and gives people the tools to succeed and thrive here,\u201d says Gorman. Whether the Biden Administration can strike a deal with Senate Republicans on comprehensive immigration reform \u2013 or even funding basic research \u2013 remains an open question, though. And even if it can succeed, American ingenuity is no longer sufficient on its own.<\/p>\n<h2>Team America<\/h2>\n<p>Whether it\u2019s for talent or partnerships, the U.S.-China tech competition will be won overseas.

It is no accident that Blinken and Sullivan\u2019s meeting in Anchorage was preceded by a trip to Japan and South Korea, two of America\u2019s closest allies in the region, and that Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga was the first foreign leader to visit Biden at the White House. \u201cIf you add the U.S. to the EU, Australia, Taiwan, and South Korea, you tilt the balance of economic heft and technological prowess back toward us,\u201d he adds.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2146533\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2146533\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2146533\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg 6901w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1312870668.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2146533\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">U.S. President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan hold a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House on April 16, 2021.

Chinese diplomats have been <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/7e508af8-0b35-4610-b52d-8c9e3e888a91\">aggressive<\/a>, if not downright condescending, to countries they perceive have slighted China. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codastory.com\/newsletters\/china-influence-monitor-april-1\/\">In one recent example<\/a>, the Chinese embassy in Dublin sent a series of tweets targeting an Irish-British journalist couple who had been forced to relocate to Taiwan as a result of a harassment campaign over their critical coverage of China\u2019s Uyghur policy in Xinjiang. This so-called \u2018wolf warrior\u2019 diplomacy (a reference to <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Wolf_Warrior\">a jingoist action film<\/a>) is prompting a <a href=\"https:\/\/foreignpolicy.com\/2021\/04\/06\/china-image-problem-wolf-warrior-international\/\">backlash<\/a>, and helping convince many policy elites in countries who had hoped to sit out a U.S.-China conflict that perhaps Washignton\u2019s China skeptics have a point.<\/p>\n<p>This perhaps explains the proliferating alpha-numeric soup of coalitions and alliances being floated to secure a free and democratic internet for the future. There\u2019s the D10, a secure supply chain network floated by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, which adds Australia, India, and South Korea to the existing G7 countries (U.S., U.K., Canada, France, Italy, Germany, and Japan). Schmidt\u2019s report calls for a T-12 (the D10 minus Italy plus Finland, Sweden, and Israel). Others look to expand existing technology-related groupings like the Five Eyes signals intelligence alliance of the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, or harness burgeoning non-technical ones like the Quad. Gorman points to the significance of the news that the Quad itself \u2013\u00a0Australia, India, Japan, and the US \u2013\u00a0announced the creation of a working group on emerging technology at its first-ever (virtual) leaders summit in March.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, Senator Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.warner.senate.gov\/public\/_cache\/files\/8\/9\/895e0a40-65ee-43cc-8629-450555faefe7\/AC6A0E54DB992E1612161C48BB34FC57.democracy-technology-partnership-act-two-pager-explainer.pdf\">proposed<\/a> a technology partnership to be run out of the State Department to coordinate with allies \u2013 including a $5 billion fund for research \u2013 with the explicit purpose of countering China.<\/p>\n<h2>International tech standards are increasingly not set by the West<\/h2>\n<p>Even if it can shephard its allies, the U.S. still faces stiff international headwinds. The Trump Administration&#8217;s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal negotiated by the Obama Administration with ten other Pacific Rim countries with the intent of setting trade standards in the Asia-Pacific, was taken as a sign that perhaps the U.S. pivot to Asia was less ambitious than advertised. The pact, rebranded as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), has continued without the U.S.\u00a0 \u2013\u00a0and now even China has expressed interest in joining.<\/p>\n<p>Trump\u2019s disdain for working within multilateral forums has also meant that Washington has essentially ceded the field of global technical standard-setting. Beijing has taken advantage, aggressively working the UN system so that Chinese officials now lead four of the 15 specialized UN agencies, including the two most focused on regulating technology: the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), which helps set global technical standards, and the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which is responsible for protecting intellectual property rights around the world.<\/p>\n<p>China is also backing Russian efforts to rewrite internet governance. With Chinese support, Russia won a UN General Assembly vote in 2019 to start drafting a new cybercrime treaty. Their goal is to replace the U.S-backed 2001 Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which was\u00a0 created by democracies through the Council of Europe, with a treaty that one critic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cfr.org\/blog\/new-un-cybercrime-treaty-way-forward-supporters-open-free-and-secure-internet\">said<\/a> would include provisions \u201clikely to provide cover to authoritarian governments to persecute their political opponents.\u201d Russia and China also unsuccessfully <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/global-opinions\/how-russia-and-china-are-attempting-to-rewrite-cyberworld-order\/2021\/03\/30\/16030226-9190-11eb-a74e-1f4cf89fd948_story.html\">tried<\/a> to use the (now Chinese-led) ITU to replace the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a private body of experts that governs internet domain names.<\/p>\n<p>These efforts are all part of China Standards 2035, an explicit plan to internationalize standards to Chinese preferences in areas like 5G and the Internet of Things (IoT).

Instead, he says, Washington should frame cooperation as \u201ccoalitions among like-minded democrtaic partners.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For that to work, the U.S. will have to work out the bilateral issues it has with its allies first. \u201cWe need to be much more savvy on engaging directly with the EU on resolving issues like data transfers, digital taxation, and data privacy,\u201d he said. \u201cDigital sovereignty shouldn\u2019t come at the expense of partnership with like-minded partners.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2146534\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2146534\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2146534\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"453\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg 3000w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=1536,1024 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=2048,1365 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/GettyImages-1173263875.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2146534\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel gives a speech during the press conference at the end of the meeting with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang (not pictured) of at The Great Hall Of The People on September 06, 2019 in Beijing, China.

This would have the benefit of keeping groupings tight without excluding countries with key expertise in particular areas (think Sweden and 5G or Taiwan and semiconductors). Washington should also take a collegiate approach, recognizing and respecting that its allies will not always be in lock-step on every aspect of the relations with China. In other words, the U.S. shouldn\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good, as agreement most of the time on most issues is probably sufficient to create the momentum Washington needs.<\/p>\n<p>The U.S. can still compete globally and widen the circle of like-minded countries, Gorman, the scholar at GMF, tells me, but it has to invest in them if they are going to build out their tech sectors in a way that is aligned with democratic values and standards. \u201cIt\u2019s really about providing an attractive counteroffer,\u201d she said.<\/p>\n<p>Even if the United States retains its technological edge for the near future, Americans should start adjusting to a future where Silicon Valley&#8217;s dominance is no longer inevitable. Chinese technologists are pulling ahead in areas like 5G while Chinese firms are competing on price (mobile phones) and increasingly on quality (e-commerce) and innovation (see: TikTok). China also exerts enormous clout through its control of supply chains and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.economist.com\/finance-and-economics\/2021\/03\/31\/governments-have-identified-commodities-essential-to-economic-and-military-security\">rare earth metals<\/a> as well as its vast customer base.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps China\u2019s greatest leverage point is its looming presence over Taiwan. As long as Taiwan remains one of the leading manufacturers of semiconductors (chip giant TSMC <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/05206915-fd73-4a3a-92a5-6760ce965bd9\">manufactures<\/a> 90% of the world\u2019s most advanced chips), the world\u2019s technology industry will be vulnerable to the precarity of cross-Strait relations.<\/p>\n<p>Will technology become just another chip in the geopolitical game the U.S. and China are playing, then? The Biden Administration is more prepared than its predecessor to weigh the tradeoffs, Barker of the German Council on Foreign Relation retells me. But it\u2019s unclear how Washington, so early in this administration, will prioritize technology issues if faced with the prospects of Chinese cooperation on other priorities.<\/p>\n<p>After all, at any given moment, the U.S. (and its allies) must weigh a host of priorities vis-\u00e0-vis China. And for all of the downsides to its bellicosity, the Trump Administration&#8217;s fixation on a handful of issues gave it leverage: it was willing to ignore Uyghurs and other human rights abuses in order to get a trade deal (even if it was deeply flawed).<\/p>\n<p>The Biden Administration, on the other hand, has not yet articulated any priorities at all. If the rhetoric from Washington can be believed, the White House thinks it can make progress on climate, Taiwan, trade, human rights, and any number of other areas, all at once. This on its own creates a vulnerability. As historian Niall Ferguson reminded us in a recent Bloomberg <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/opinion\/articles\/2021-03-21\/niall-ferguson-a-taiwan-crisis-may-end-the-american-empire\">column<\/a>, then National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger was outmaneuvered when he went to China in 1971 with a multi-issue agenda and China singularly focused on Taiwan.<\/p>\n<p>Beijing\u2019s diplomats, despite their wolf-warrior missteps, are still savvy negotiators. If they are allowed to do so, they will once again try to play different parts of the Administration against each other, conditioning progress on climate, for example, on a softening over geopolitics, as the Brookings scholar Thomas Wright has <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theatlantic.com\/ideas\/archive\/2020\/12\/risk-john-kerry-following-his-own-china-policy\/617459\/\">warned<\/a>. In that light, it simply strains credulity that an \u2018all of the above\u2019 approach will work, especially when Biden\u2019s wish list keeps the issues Trump cared about, like trade, 5G, and Taiwan, and adds those he ignored, like human rights, democracy, and climate change.<\/p>\n<p>This is where America\u2019s alliances may prove to be Biden\u2019s hidden ace. If Biden can forge a common-enough front with a wide-enough spectrum of allies, the U.S. will be better able to withstand Chinese pressure to trade progress on one issue against another. Instead, forcing China to negotiate with the U.S. and its allies on an issue-by-issue basis may put Washington in a better position to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Of all the issues in America\u2019s China portfolio, though, the tech race provides one extra advantage: for all the talk of industrial strategy, alliances, and diplomatic maneuvers, Washington is not the only or even primary actor involved. The Biden Administration can help set the rules, invest in basic research, and defend American interests abroad, but American innovation depends on its innovators \u2013 and there are still bountiful numbers of them tinkering away.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5JEvJDAzw0\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/06\/will-the-clubhouse-model-work-in-china\/\">Will the Clubhouse model work in China?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Will the Clubhouse model work in China?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/06\/will-the-clubhouse-model-work-in-china\/embed\/#?secret=5JEvJDAzw0\" data-secret=\"5JEvJDAzw0\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When Secretary of State Antony Blinken and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan sat down with Chinese officials in Anchorage, Alaska for the first high-level bilateral summit of the new administration, it was not a typical diplomatic meeting.

In this four-part series on the future of technology and disaster response, to be published this weekend and next, we\u2019ll look at the sales cycle in this market, how data is finally starting to flow into disaster response, how utilities and particularly telcos are dealing with internet access issues, and how communities are redefining disaster management going forward.<\/p>\n<p>Before we get into all the tech developments in disaster response and resilience though, it\u2019s important to ask a basic question: if you build it, will they come? The resounding answer from founders, investors, and government procurement officials was simple: no.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, in all my conversations for this series, the hell of the emergency management sales cycle came up repeatedly, with more than one individual describing it as possibly the toughest sale that any company could make in the entire world. That view might be surprising in a market that easily runs into the tens of billions of dollars if the budgets for procurement are aggregated across local, state, federal, and international governments. Yet, as we will see, the unique dynamics of this market make almost any traditional sales approach useless.<\/p>\n<p>Despite that pessimism though, that doesn\u2019t mean sales are impossible, and a new crop of startups are piercing the barriers of entry in this market. We\u2019ll look at the sales and product strategies that startups are increasingly relying on today to break through.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"The sale from hell\">The sale from hell<\/h2>\n<p>Few will be surprised that government sales are hard. Generations of govtech startup founders have learned that slow sales cycles, byzantine procurement processes, cumbersome verification and security requirements, and a general lassitude among contract officers makes for a tough battlefield to close on revenue. Many government agencies now have programs to specifically onboard startups, having discovered just how hard it is for new innovations to run through their gauntlet.<\/p>\n<p>Emergency management sales share all the same problems as other govtech startups, but then they deal with about a half dozen more problems that make the sales cycle go from exhausting to infernal hell.<\/p>\n<p>The first and most painful is the dramatic seasonality of the sales in the emergency space. Many agencies that operate on seasonal disasters \u2014 think hurricanes, wildfires, winter storms, and more \u2014 often go through an \u201caction\u201d period where they respond to these disasters, and then transition into a \u201cplanning\u201d period where they assess their performance, determine what changes are needed for next season, and consider what tools might be added or removed to increase the effectiveness of their responders.<\/p>\n<p>Take <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/02\/cornea-eyes-in-on-fighting-wildfires-using-better-data\/\">Cornea<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/12\/when-wildfires-rage-close-perimeter-wants-to-tell-you-where-to-go\/\">Perimeter<\/a>, two startups in the wildfire response space that I profiled recently. Both of the teams described how they needed to think in terms of fire seasons when it came to product iteration and sales. \u201cWe took two fire seasons to beta test our technology \u2026 to solve the right problem the right way,\u201d Bailey Farren, CEO and co-founder of Perimeter, said. \u201cWe actually changed our focus on beta testing during the [2019 California] Kincaid fire.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In this way, disaster tech could be compared to edtech, where school technology purchases are often synchronized with the academic calendar. Miss the June through August window in the U.S. education system, and a startup is looking at another year before it will get another chance at the classroom.<\/p>\n<p>Edtech might once have been a tougher sale to make in order to thread that three-month needle, but disaster response is getting more difficult every year. Climate change is exacerbating the length, severity, and damage caused by all types of disasters, which means that responding agencies that might have had six months or more out-of-season to plan in the past are sometimes working all year long just to respond to emergencies. That gives little time to think about what new solutions an agency needs to purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Worse, unlike the standardized academic calendar, disasters are much less predictable these days as well. Flood and wildfire seasons, for instance, used to be relatively concentrated in certain periods of the year. Now, such emergencies can emerge practically year-round. That means that procurement processes can both start and freeze on a moment\u2019s notice as an agency has to respond to its mission.<\/p>\n<p>Seasonality doesn\u2019t just apply to the sales cycle though \u2014 it also applies to the budgets of these agencies. While they are transpiring, disasters dominate the eye of the minds for citizens and politicians, but then we forget all about them until the next catastrophe. Unlike the annual consistency of other government tech spending, disaster tech funding often comes in waves.<\/p>\n<p>One senior federal emergency management official, who asked not to be named since he wasn\u2019t authorized to speak publicly, explained that consistent budgets and the ability to spend them quickly is quite limited during \u201cblue sky days\u201d (i.e. periods without a disaster), and agencies like his have to rely on piecing together supplementary disaster funds when Congress or state legislatures authorize additional financing. The best agencies have technological roadmaps on hand so that when extra funding comes in, they can use it immediately to realize their plans, but not all agencies have the technical planning resources to be that prepared.<\/p>\n<p>Amir Elichai, the CEO and co-founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/carbyne911.com\">Carbyne<\/a>, a cloud-native platform for call handling in 911 centers, said that this wave of interest crested yet again with the COVID-19 pandemic last year, triggering huge increases in attention and funding around emergency response capabilities. \u201cCOVID put a mirror in front of government faces and showed them that \u2018we\u2019re not ready\u2019,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, next-generation 911 services (typically dubbed NG911), which have been advocated for years by the industry and first responders, is looking at a major financing boost. President Biden\u2019s proposed infrastructure bill <a href=\"https:\/\/urgentcomm.com\/2021\/03\/17\/house-proposes-15-billion-for-ng911-funding-in-new-infrastructure-bill\/\">would add $15 billion to upgrade 911 capabilities in the United States<\/a> \u2014 funding that has been requested for much of the last decade. Just last year, <a href=\"https:\/\/urgentcomm.com\/2020\/07\/03\/house-approves-12-billion-for-ng911-funding-in-infrastructure-package-but-bill-unlikely-to-pass-senate\/\">a $12 billion variant of that bill failed in the Senate after passing the U.S. House of Representatives<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Sales are all about providing proverbial painkillers versus vitamins to customers, and one would expect that disaster response agencies looking to upgrade their systems would be very much on the painkiller side. After all, the fear and crisis surrounding these agencies and their work would seem to bring visceral attention to their needs.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, that fear actually has the opposite effect in many cases, driving attention away from systematic technology upgrades in favor of immediate acute solutions. One govtech VC, who asked not to be named to speak candidly about the procurement process his companies go through, said that \u201cwe don\u2019t want to paint the picture that the world is a scary and dangerous place.\u201d Instead, \u201cthe trick is to be \u2026 focused on the safety side rather than the danger.\u201d Safety is a much more prevalent and consistent need than sporadically responding to emergencies.<\/p>\n<p>When a wave of funding finally gets approved though, agencies often have to scramble to figure out what to prioritize now that the appropriated manna has finally dropped from the legislative heaven. Even when startups provide the right solutions, scrying which problems are going to get funded in a particular cycle requires acute attention to every customer.<\/p>\n<p>Josh Mendelsohn, the managing partner at startup studio and venture fund <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hangar.is\">Hangar<\/a>, said that \u201cthe customers have no shortage of needs that they are happy to talk about \u2026 the hardest part is how you narrow the funnel \u2014 what are the problems that are most meritorious?\u201d That merit can, unfortunately, evolve very rapidly as mission requirements change.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say all the stars line up though \u2014 the agencies have time to buy, they have a need, and a startup has the solution that they want. The final challenge that\u2019s probably the toughest to overcome is simply the lack of trust that new startups have with agencies.<\/p>\n<p>In talking to emergency response officials the past few weeks, reliability unsurprisingly came up again and again. Responding to disasters is mission-critical work, and nothing can break in the field or in the operations center. Frontline responders still use paper and pens in lieu of tablets or mobile phones since they know that paper is going to work every single time and not run out of battery juice. The move fast and break things ethos of Silicon Valley is fundamentally incompatible with this market.<\/p>\n<p>Seasonality, on-and-off funding, lack of attention, procurement scrambling, and acute reliability requirements combine to make emergency management sales among the hardest possible for a startup. That doesn\u2019t even get into all the typical govtech challenges like integrating with legacy systems, the massive fragmentation of thousands of emergency response agencies littered across the United States and globally, and the fact that in many agencies, people aren\u2019t that interested in change in the first place. As one individual in the space described how governments approach emergency technology, \u201ca lot of departments are looking at it as maybe I can hit retirement before I have to deal with it.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"The strategies for breaking out of limbo\">The strategies for breaking out of limbo<\/h2>\n<p>So the sales cycle is hell. Why, then, are VCs dropping money in the sector? After all, we\u2019ve seen emergency response data platform <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/09\/rapidsos-raises-85m-for-its-emergency-response-data-platform\/\">RapidSOS raise $85 million just a few months ago<\/a>, about the same time <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/01\/14\/carbyne-raises-25m-for-a-next-generation-platform-to-improve-emergency-911-responses\/\">Carbyne raised $25 million<\/a>. There are quite a few more startups at the earliest phases that have raised pre-seed and seed investment as well.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"5edu1wQy7e\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/09\/rapidsos-raises-85m-for-its-emergency-response-data-platform\/\">RapidSOS raises $85M for a big data platform aimed at emergency responders<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;RapidSOS raises $85M for a big data platform aimed at emergency responders&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/09\/rapidsos-raises-85m-for-its-emergency-response-data-platform\/embed\/#?secret=5edu1wQy7e\" data-secret=\"5edu1wQy7e\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The key argument that nearly everyone in this sector agreed on is that founders (and their investors) have to throw away their private-sector sales playbooks and rebuild their approach from the bottom up to sell specifically to these agencies. That means devising entirely different strategies and tactics to secure revenue performance.<\/p>\n<p>The first and most important approach is, in some respects, to not even start with a company at all, but rather to start learning what people in this field actually do. As the sales cycle perhaps indicates, disaster response is unlike any other work. The chaos, the rapidly changing environment, the multi-disciplinary teams and cross-agency work that has to take place for a response to be effective have few parallels to professional office work. Empathy is key here: the responder that uses paper might have nearly lost their life in the field when their device failed. A 911 center operator may have listened to someone perish in real-time as they scrambled to find the right information from a software database.<\/p>\n<p>In short, it\u2019s all about customer discovery and development. That\u2019s not so different from the enterprise world, but patience radiated out of many of my conversations with industry participants. It just takes more time \u2014 sometimes multiple seasons \u2014 to figure out precisely what to build and how to sell it effectively. If an enterprise SaaS product can iterate to market-fit in six months, it might take two to three years in the government sector to reach an equivalent point.<\/p>\n<p>Michael Martin of RapidSOS said \u201cThere is no shortcut to doing customer discovery work in public service.\u201d He noted that \u201cI do think there is a real challenge between the arrogance of the Silicon Valley tech community and the reality of these challenges\u201c in public safety, a gap that has to be closed if a startup wants to find success. Meanwhile, Bryce Stirton, president and co-founder of public-safety company Responder Corp, said that \u201cThe end user is the best way to look at all the challenges \u2026 what are all the boxes the end user has to check to use a new technology?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mendelsohn of Hangar said that founders need to answer some tough questions in that process. \u201cUltimately, what are your entry points,\u201d he asked. \u201cCornea has had to go through that customer discovery process \u2026 it all feels necessary, but what are the right things that require the least amount of behavior change to have impact immediately?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Indeed, that process is appreciated on the other side as well. The federal emergency management official said, \u201ceveryone has a solution, but no one asked me about my problem.\u201d Getting the product right and having it match the unique work that takes place in this market is key.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you have a great product though \u2014 how do you get it through the perilous challenges of the procurement process? Here, answers differed widely, and they offer multiple strategies on how to approach the problem.<\/p>\n<p>Martin of RapidSOS said that \u201cgovernment does not have a good model for procuring new services to solve problems.\u201d So, the company chose to make its services free for government. \u201cIn three years, we went from no agencies using our stuff to all agencies using our stuff, and that was based on not making it a procurement problem,\u201d he said. The company\u2019s business model is based on having paid corporate partners who want to integrate their data into 911 centers for safety purposes.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s a similar model used by <a href=\"https:\/\/mdally.com\">MD Ally<\/a>, which <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/28\/md-ally-connects-telehealth-alternatives-right-into-911-calls\/\">received a $3.5 million seed check from General Catalyst this past week<\/a>. The company adds telehealth referral services into 911 dispatch systems, and CEO and founder Shanel Fields emphasized that she saw an opportunity to create a revenue engine from the physician and mental health provider side of her market while avoiding government procurement.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"yWp4rUGpeP\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/28\/md-ally-connects-telehealth-alternatives-right-into-911-calls\/\">MD Ally connects telehealth alternatives right into 911 calls<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;MD Ally connects telehealth alternatives right into 911 calls&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/28\/md-ally-connects-telehealth-alternatives-right-into-911-calls\/embed\/#?secret=yWp4rUGpeP\" data-secret=\"yWp4rUGpeP\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Outside of what might be dubbed \u201cRobinhood for government\u201d (aka, just offering a service for free), another approach is to link up with more well-known and trusted brand names to offer a product that has the innovation of a startup but the reliability of an established player. Stirton of Responder said \u201cwe learned in [this market] that it takes more than just capital to get companies started in this space.\u201d What he found worked was building private-sector partnerships to bring a joint offering to governments. For instance, he noted cloud providers Amazon Web Services and Verizon have good reputations with governments and can get startups over procurement hurdles (TechCrunch is owned by Verizon Media, which is owned by Verizon).<\/p>\n<p>Elichai of Carbyne notes that much of his sales is done through integration partners, referencing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.centralsquare.com\">CenterSquare<\/a> as one example. For 911 services, \u201cThe U.S. market is obviously the most fragmented\u201d and so partners allow the company to avoid selling to thousands of different agencies. \u201cWe are usually not selling direct to governments,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Partners can also help deal with the problem of localism in emergency procurement: many government agencies don\u2019t know precisely what to buy, so they simply buy software that is offered by companies in their own backyard. Partners can offer a local presence while also allowing a startup to have a nimble national footprint.<\/p>\n<p>Another angle on partners is building out a roster of experienced but retired government executives who can give credibility to a startup through their presence and networks. Even more than in enterprise, government officials, particularly in emergency management, have to work and trust one another given the closely-coupled work that they perform. Hearing a positive recommendation from a close contact down the street can readily change the tenor of a sales conversation.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, as much as emergency management software is geared for governments, private sector companies increasingly have to consider much of the same tooling to protect their operations. Many companies have distributed workforces, field teams, and physical assets they need to protect, and often have to respond to disasters in much the same way that governments do. For some startups, it\u2019s possible to bootstrap in the private sector early on while continuing to assiduously develop public sector relationships.<\/p>\n<p>In short, a long-term customer development program coupled with quality partnerships and joint offerings while not forgetting the private sector offers the best path for startups to break through into these agencies.<\/p>\n<p>The good news is that the hard work can be rewarded. Not only are there serious dollars that flow through these agencies, but the agencies themselves know that they need better technology. Tom Harbour, who is chief fire officer at Cornea and formerly national director of fire management at the U.S. Forest Service, notes that \u201cThese are billions of dollars we spend \u2026 and we know we can be more efficient.\u201d Government doesn\u2019t always make it easy to create efficiency, but for the founders willing to go the distance, they can build impactful, profitable, and mission-driven companies.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: center;\">Future of Technology and Disaster Response Table of Contents<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Part 1: The most disastrous sales cycle in the world: The future of sales<\/strong><\/li>\n<li><b>Part 2:<\/b> <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/02\/data-was-the-new-oil-until-the-oil-caught-fire\/\">Data was the new oil, until the oil caught fire: Data and Artificial Intelligence<\/a><\/li>\n<li><b>Part 3:<\/b> Upcoming<\/li>\n<li><b>Part 4:<\/b> Upcoming<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<hr \/>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PDObiFk8Gt\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/02\/data-was-the-new-oil-until-the-oil-caught-fire\/\">Data was the new oil, until the oil caught fire<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Data was the new oil, until the oil caught fire&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/05\/02\/data-was-the-new-oil-until-the-oil-caught-fire\/embed\/#?secret=PDObiFk8Gt\" data-secret=\"PDObiFk8Gt\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Startups constantly talk about being mission-oriented, but it\u2019s hard to take most of those messages seriously when the mission is optimizing cash flow for tax efficiency.

Through a small pop-up message asking users if the app can track them, Apple has disrupted a multibillion-dollar adtech industry, altered the course of tech giants like Facebook and drawn possible <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know\/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29\">lawsuits<\/a> and antitrust <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/21\/04\/26\/german-advertisers-file-antitrust-complaint-over-apples-app-tracking-transparency?utm_medium=rss\">complaints<\/a>, all in the name of protecting consumer privacy. Apple does believe in privacy and user control &#8212; you can tell that from the way the company has built its technology to do things like on-device processing or permissions toggles that let people decide what their apps can and cannot do.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"o4wmAxOCnW\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know\/\">Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature has arrived \u2014 here&#8217;s what you need to know<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Apple&#8217;s App Tracking Transparency feature has arrived \u2014 here&#8217;s what you need to know&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know\/embed\/#?secret=o4wmAxOCnW\" data-secret=\"o4wmAxOCnW\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>But Apple will also benefit from this particular privacy reform, too. Its own first-party apps can collect data and share it with other first-party apps. That means what you do in apps like the App Store, Apple News, Stocks and others can be used to personalize Apple&#8217;s own ads. And the company is prepared to capitalize on this opportunity too, with the addition of a new ad slot on the App Store (in <a href=\"https:\/\/appleinsider.com\/articles\/21\/04\/26\/german-advertisers-file-antitrust-complaint-over-apples-app-tracking-transparency?utm_medium=rss\">the Suggested section<\/a> on the Search tab.) If it wants to roll out more ads over time to other businesses &#8212; perhaps, those podcasts it got newly interested in after Spotify did? Or in its streaming TV service or fitness solution? Perhaps the ads it sells in Apple News? &#8212; then it would have access to valuable data it could use. Oh and the next time you open the App Store or Apple News, you won&#8217;t be bothered with one of those pesky warnings! Nope &#8212; that&#8217;s only for <em>third<\/em>-parties, a <em>very<\/em> important distinction! If you want to turn off Apple&#8217;s own ability to track you across its growing number of apps, that&#8217;s at the VERY bottom of iOS&#8217;s Privacy Settings.<\/p>\n<h3>We heard you like Spotify, so we put Spotify in your Facebook app<\/h3>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2143531\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2143531\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2143531\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-banner-2.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"260\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-banner-2.png 1920w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-banner-2.png?resize=150,57 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-banner-2.png?resize=300,115 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-banner-2.png?resize=768,294 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-banner-2.png?resize=680,260 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-banner-2.png?resize=1536,587 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/Boombox-banner-2.png?resize=50,19 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2143531\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Spotify<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Facebook and Spotify <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/facebook-introduces-a-new-miniplayer-that-streams-spotify-within-the-facebook-app\/\">expanded<\/a> their partnership this week. The companies had earlier announced their plans to make it easier for Facebook users to stream music and podcasts from the Facebook app. On Monday, this integration began rolling out in the form of a miniplayer experience that allows Facebook users to stream from Spotify through the Facebook app on iOS or Android.<\/p>\n<p>The feature is available to both free and paying Spotify users and will allow them each to hear the full song or podcast episode being shared. However, free users will then be moved into &#8220;shuffle&#8221; mode if they continue to listen after the song plays.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s interesting about this integration is that it&#8217;s not actually streaming Spotify through Facebook. The miniplayer activates and controls the launch and playback in the Spotify app \u2014 which is how the playback is able to continue even as the user scrolls on Facebook or if they minimize the Facebook app altogether. This gives the appearance of Facebook doing the streaming. (Songs on social! Cue Myspace vibes!)<\/p>\n<p>Spotify says users can&#8217;t upgrade to Spotify Premium from the miniplayer directly, so there&#8217;s no rev share there. It&#8217;s also paying the royalties on streams, as usual. But it&#8217;s getting massive distribution through Facebook, driving signups and repeat usage, while Facebook gets a way to keep users on its app longer. Win-win.

I think it&#8217;s fair to say we&#8217;ve lived through a very strange reality this past year. With all the chaos and change, we&#8217;re led to a foundational question: what&#8217;s the purpose of speculative fiction and its adjacent genres of science fiction and fantasy when so much of our world seems to already embody the fantastical worlds these works depict?<\/p>\n<p>So I got our occasional fictional columnist <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eliotpeper.com\">Eliot Peper<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.eliotpeper.com\/p\/blog-page.html\">the author of Veil, the three part Analog Series and other speculative fiction novels<\/a> on the Gmail for an epistolary conversation on digesting 2020, the meaning of speculative fiction, and the future of art.<\/p>\n<p><em>This conversation has been lightly edited and condensed.<\/em><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>Danny Crichton<\/strong>: I&#8217;m curious about the future of speculative fiction. We just went through a devastating year with the pandemic and a number of major climate disorders \u2013 the types of events that are among the fodder for this genre. How do you keep speculating when reality always seems to catch up with the amygdala of our imaginations?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Eliot Peper<\/strong>: Current events are a painful reminder that unlike fiction, reality needn&#8217;t be plausible. The world is complex and even the wisest of us understand only a tiny sliver of what&#8217;s really going on. Nobody knows what comes next. So while it may feel like we&#8217;re living in a science fiction novel, that&#8217;s because we&#8217;ve\u00a0<i>always been\u00a0<\/i>living in a science fiction novel. Or maybe speculative fiction is more real than so-called\u00a0realist\u00a0fiction because the only certainty is that tomorrow will be different from today and from what we\u00a0expect.\u00a0Depicting a world without fundamental change has become fantastical.<\/p>\n<p>As a writer of speculative fiction, I&#8217;m an enthusiastic reader of history. And in reading about the past to slake my curiosity and imagine possible futures, I&#8217;ve learned that the present is exceedingly contingent, fascinating, and fleeting. For me, speculative fiction is less about prediction than it is about riffing on how the world is changing like a jazz musician might improvise over a standard. Accuracy only happens by mistake. The most interesting rendition wins because it makes people think, dream,\u00a0<i>feel<\/i>. And thanks to technological\u00a0leverage, to a greater and greater extent people are inventing the future \u2013 for better and for worse.<\/p>\n<p>So I&#8217;m not worried about reality catching up with speculative fiction because speculative fiction is rooted in the human experience of reality. Every black swan event is simply new material.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crichton<\/strong>: So this gets at a challenge that I think blurs the line between realist and speculative fiction and makes these works so hard to categorize. To me, the reality of the pandemic isn&#8217;t the black swan that a novel virus could take hold across the planet (after all, pandemics are actually quite common in history), but rather the black swan of the completely shambolic response that we witnessed, one that was not at all well-coordinated.<\/p>\n<p>If I were designing a speculative fiction scenario, I don&#8217;t think I could come up with &#8220;we develop a cure extremely rapidly thanks to the progress of medical science, but the general\u00a0day-to-day response of people is to massively inflate the death totals through their own actions.&#8221; When I think speculative, I think spectacular \u2014 something exceptional, but this particular black swan shows the power of the mundane actions of our lives to influence the course of events.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Peper<\/strong>:\u00a0Speculative fiction is all about asking &#8220;what if?&#8221; What if a lone astronaut got stranded on Mars? What if genetic engineers resurrected dinosaurs and stuck them in an amusement park? What if we are all living in a simulation? The question that sparked my latest novel,\u00a0<i>Veil<\/i>, is &#8220;what if a billionaire hijacked the climate with geoengineering?&#8221; These questions are hooks. They capture the imagination and pique curiosity. That&#8217;s all well and good, but it&#8217;s only a starting point.<\/p>\n<p>To pay off a speculative setup, you need to keep the dominos falling as second-, third-, and fourth-order effects ripple out through the story. Momentum builds. Progressive complications tighten the ratchet. Unexpected reversals fling the reader forward. If an earthquake flattens San Francisco in your story, it&#8217;s easy to imagine potential physical consequences: the Bay Bridge collapsing, BART flooding, the power going out, gas leaks, fires, etc. It&#8217;s less obvious but at least as important to imagine the potential social consequences: Do people risk their lives to rescue their neighbors or fight over limited emergency supplies? How do the governor and the president respond given their particular personalities, incentives, and constituencies? How might such an event rework the social fabric of the Bay Area? (Also, crucially,\u00a0<i>where is Dwayne Johnson?<\/i>)\u00a0How people respond to events is integral to how events play out.<\/p>\n<p>Published in April 2020, Lawrence Wright&#8217;s\u00a0<i>The End of October<\/i>\u00a0does an eerily good job extrapolating the messy, cascading social and political reactions to a global pandemic. Kurt Vonnegut&#8217;s\u00a0<i>Gal\u00e1pagos<\/i>\u00a0depicts an apocalyptic scenario driven by such mundane, shambolic human shortsightedness that it feels nearly absurd enough to be realistic. While some science fiction overindexes technological change, Ada Palmer&#8217;s brilliant <em>Terra Ignota<\/em> series imagines the cultural, political, and sociological aspects of a fictional future with extraordinary rigor. So often, human behavior is the X-factor that transforms and amplifies the impacts of the original scenario,\u00a0shaping a new world in the process.<\/p>\n<p>This hints at a deeper question though: What is fiction for?<\/p>\n<p>When I write fiction, I am not trying to accurately depict or anticipate reality. I&#8217;m trying to create an experience, to take the reader on a journey that is compelling, surprising, and fulfilling. Even though part of the fun might be extrapolating a scenario rooted in a particularly intriguing facet of the real world, success isn&#8217;t getting things right. Success is a reader turning pages deep into the night to find out what happens next in a story they can&#8217;t put down and won&#8217;t soon forget.<\/p>\n<p>Neil Gaiman likes to say that fairy tales are\u00a0more than true \u2013 not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten. When it comes to speculative fiction, I love stories that reveal a deep emotional truth or illuminate an underlying force shaping the course of history even if they are wildly but entertainingly wrong about literal details. That doesn&#8217;t mean that striving for technical accuracy is bad, just that it isn&#8217;t always the point. The point might instead be to make you think, to make you feel, to make you imagine how the world might be different.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crichton<\/strong>: So on that last point, I&#8217;m curious how you think about imagination and its power for change. Obviously, art has had a sustained and powerful impact\u00a0on the imagination of people throughout\u00a0history, and there are often artistic antecedents\u00a0to large societal, cultural, and political changes. Part of its power historically though, at least from my perspective, was its rarity and its ability to surprise.<\/p>\n<p>Today, we are just subsumed in imaginative worlds, from video games to movies to streaming television\u00a0shows to books and graphic novels and on and on. If you read time-use studies, Americans are awash in imaginative contexts for potentially a majority of their waking hours. I feel like I&#8217;ve been increasingly seeing this gap between the extreme breadth of imagination available in our art, but the extreme\u00a0narrowness for change in our daily lives. Is that a threat to the ability of art to provoke change? Is speculation still an activity that can lead to action?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Peper<\/strong>: Speculation is part of what it means to be human. Before we make a choice, we imagine the possible consequences. We simulate potential futures in daydreams before committing\u00a0to them in reality. Our mental projections are often wrong, but they are also often useful. For better and for worse, thought experiment is foundational to our internal lives. This individual dynamic scales to the human collective: Imagining a better future is the first step toward building one.<\/p>\n<p>Art is a vehicle for imagination. A filmmaker\u00a0codifies their vision in a movie that others can watch and, in watching, exercise\u00a0their respective imaginations \u2013 sometimes even sparking new creative\u00a0endeavors that\u00a0spin off into yet more projects that together form what we call culture. Technology has made more movies, books, songs, poems, photos, paintings, comics, podcasts, and games available and accessible to more people than ever before. Imagined worlds are an integral part of the real world as we experience it, layering meaning and possibility onto actual events. We are all interpreting reality for each other all the time, transforming it in the process. The increasing density and intensity of that process is the result of a growing population that is knitting itself together ever more tightly along ever more dimensions.<\/p>\n<p>But technology hasn&#8217;t just made new artistic mediums possible and changed the ways in which people make, discover, and experience art. Technology amplifies the impact of human choices. Hippocrates couldn&#8217;t have invented an mRNA vaccine, Genghis Khan couldn&#8217;t have pressed a button to initiate a nuclear apocalypse, and Odysseus had to build his Trojan Horse out of wood instead of code.<\/p>\n<p>Our tools give us superpowers our ancestors never imagined and the consequences of our decisions scale accordingly. Because technical ingenuity is morally neutral, technological development ratchets up the stakes for timeless questions of human agency \u2013 what does it mean to live a good life, to contribute to the greater good, to be a good ancestor? This is the moral geography to which artists offer diverse, imperfect, contradictory, and occasionally\u00a0invaluable maps. So in a certain sense, the more technology empowers us, the more we need art.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There&#8217;s an old saw from Mark Twain about how truth is stranger than fiction, and I think it&#8217;s fair to say we&#8217;ve lived through a very strange reality this past year.

incredible year. But one indicator points to longer-term changes. The internal rate of return (IRR) for companies in other startup hub cities has been even better. A <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/27\/internal-rates-of-return-in-emerging-us-tech-hubs-are-starting-to-overtake-silicon-valley\/\">big new analysis by AngelList<\/a> showed aggregate IRR of 19.4% per year on syndicated deals elsewhere versus 17.5% locally. A separate measure, of total value of paid-in investment, revealed 1.67x returns for other hubs versus 1.60x in the main Silicon Valley and Bay Area tech cities.<\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><i>Full Extra Crunch articles are only available to members.<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/subscribe\/\">Use discount code\u00a0<strong>ECFriday<\/strong><\/a>\u00a0to save 20% off a one- or two-year subscription.<\/i><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p>The data is based on a sample of 2,500 companies that have used AngelList to syndicate deals from 2013 through 2020. Which is just one snapshot, but a relevant one given how hard it can be to produce accurate early-stage startup market analysis at this scale. I believe we&#8217;ll see more and more data confirming the trends in the coming years, especially as more of the startup world acclimates to remote-first and distributed offices. You can increasingly do a startup from anywhere and make it a success.

Studies often claim that millions of jobs are going unfilled because there aren\u2019t enough qualified candidates available for hire.<\/p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t buy it.<\/p>\n<p>The basic laws of supply and demand mean there will always be people in the workforce willing to move into well-paid security jobs. The problem is not that these folks don\u2019t exist. It\u2019s that CIOs or CISOs typically look right past them if their resumes don\u2019t have a very specific list of qualifications.<\/p>\n<p>In many cases, hiring managers expect applicants to be fully trained on all the technologies their organization currently uses. That not only makes it harder to find qualified candidates, but it also reduces the diversity of experience within security teams \u2014 which, ultimately, may weaken the company\u2019s security capabilities and its talent pool.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"exgfKxzSvB\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/there-is-no-cybersecurity-skills-gap-but-cisos-must-think-creatively\/\">There is no cybersecurity skills gap, but CISOs must think creatively<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;There is no cybersecurity skills gap, but CISOs must think creatively&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/there-is-no-cybersecurity-skills-gap-but-cisos-must-think-creatively\/embed\/#?secret=exgfKxzSvB\" data-secret=\"exgfKxzSvB\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2>To be frank, we do not know how to value Honest Company<\/h2>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_1996009\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1996009\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1996009\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg 2880w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=150,113 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=300,225 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=768,576 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=680,510 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=1536,1152 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=2048,1536 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/NSussman_Techcrunch_Exchange_v3-GRN.jpg?resize=50,38 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-1996009\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nigelsussman.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Nigel Sussman <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>We do not know how to value Honest Company.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s outside our normal remit, but that the company is getting out the door at what appears to be a workable price gain to its final private round implies that investors earlier in its cap table are set to do just fine in its debut.

The insurance market is enormous, but the sector has suffered from notoriously poor customer experience, and major incumbents have been slow to adapt. Fintech has set a precedent for the explosive growth that can be achieved with superior customer experience underpinned by modern technology.

This data contains excellent business insights and immense opportunities, but it has become impossible for companies to derive actionable insights from this data consistently due to its sheer volume.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.verifiedmarketresearch.com\/product\/global-analytics-as-a-service-market-size-and-forecast-to-2025\/\">Verified Market Research<\/a>, the analytics-as-a-service (AaaS) market is expected to grow to $101.29 billion by 2026. Organizations that have not started on their analytics journey or are spending scarce data engineer resources to resolve issues with analytics implementations are not identifying actionable data insights. Through AaaS, managed services providers (MSPs) can help organizations get started on their analytics journey immediately without extravagant capital investment.<\/p>\n<p>MSPs can take ownership of the company&#8217;s immediate data analytics needs, resolve ongoing challenges and integrate new data sources to manage dashboard visualizations, reporting and predictive modeling \u2014 enabling companies to make data-driven decisions every day.<\/p>\n<p>AaaS could come bundled with multiple business-intelligence-related services. Primarily, the service includes (1) services for data warehouses; (2) services for visualizations and reports; and (3) services for predictive analytics, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). When a company partners with an MSP for analytics as a service, organizations are able to tap into business intelligence easily, instantly and at a lower cost of ownership than doing it in-house. This empowers the enterprise to focus on delivering better customer experiences, be unencumbered with decision-making and build data-driven strategies.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tOrganizations that have not started on their analytics journey or are spending scarce data engineer resources to resolve issues with analytics implementations are not identifying actionable data insights.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<p>In today&#8217;s world, where customers value experiences over transactions, AaaS helps businesses dig deeper into their psyche and tap insights to build long-term winning strategies.

sent a legal threat to a security researcher for offering to share an open-source software project with other researchers, which What3Words claims violate its copyright.<\/p>\n<p>Aaron Toponce, a systems administrator at XMission, received a letter on Thursday from a law firm representing What3Words, requesting that he delete tweets related to the open-source alternative, WhatFreeWords. The letter also demands that he disclose to the law firm the identity of the person or people with whom he had shared a copy of the software, agree that he would not make any further copies of the software and to delete any copies of the software he had in his possession.<\/p>\n<p>The letter gave him until May 7 to agree, after which What3Words would &#8220;waive any entitlement it may have to pursue related claims against you,&#8221; a thinly-veiled threat of legal action.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This is not a battle worth fighting,&#8221; he said <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/AaronToponce\/status\/1387933438305394690?s=20\">in a tweet<\/a>. Toponce told TechCrunch that he has complied with the demands, fearing legal repercussions if he didn&#8217;t. He has also asked the law firm twice for links to the tweets they want deleting but has not heard back. &#8220;Depending on the tweet, I may or may not comply.

(Image: supplied)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>U.K.-based What3Words divides the entire world into three-meter squares and labels each with a unique three-word phrase. The idea is that sharing three words is easier to share on the phone in an emergency than having to find and read out their precise geographic coordinates.<\/p>\n<p>But security researcher Andrew Tierney <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/technology-56901363\">recently discovered<\/a> that What3Words would sometimes have two similarly-named squares less than a mile apart, potentially causing confusion about a person&#8217;s true whereabouts. In a later write-up, Tierney said What3Words was <a href=\"https:\/\/cybergibbons.com\/security-2\/why-what3words-is-not-suitable-for-safety-critical-applications\/\">not adequate<\/a> for use in safety-critical cases.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the only downside. Critics have <a href=\"https:\/\/shkspr.mobi\/blog\/2019\/03\/why-bother-with-what-three-words\/ \">long argued<\/a> that What3Words&#8217; proprietary geocoding technology, which it bills as &#8220;life-saving,&#8221; makes it harder to examine it for problems or security vulnerabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Concerns about its lack of openness in part led to the creation of the WhatFreeWords. A copy of <a href=\"https:\/\/justpaste.it\/39hat\">the project&#8217;s website<\/a>, which does not contain the code itself, said the open-source alternative was developed by reverse-engineering What3Words. &#8220;Once we found out how it worked, we coded implementations for it for JavaScript and Go,&#8221; the website said. &#8220;To ensure that we did not violate the What3Words company&#8217;s copyright, we did not include any of their code, and we only included the bare minimum data required for interoperability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But the project&#8217;s website was nevertheless subjected to a <a href=\"https:\/\/ivan.sanchezortega.es\/w3w-bullying\/2019-09-19\/SCIP%20-%20Ecommerce%20Takedown%20Notice%20-%20W3W%2019%20Sept%202019.pdf\">copyright takedown request<\/a> filed by What3Words&#8217; counsel. Even <a href=\"https:\/\/www.owenboswarva.com\/misc\/W3W_Twitter_20191007.pdf\">tweets<\/a> that pointed to cached or backup copies of the code were removed by Twitter at the lawyers&#8217; requests.<\/p>\n<p>Toponce \u2014 a security researcher on the side \u2014 contributed to Tierney&#8217;s research, who was <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cybergibbons\/status\/1387164574294712321\">tweeting out<\/a> his findings as he went. Toponce said that he offered to share a copy of the WhatFreeWords code with other researchers to help Tierney with his ongoing research into What3Words. Toponce told TechCrunch that receiving the legal threat may have been a combination of offering to share the code and also finding problems with What3Words.<\/p>\n<p>In its letter to Toponce, What3Words argues that WhatFreeWords contains its intellectual property and that the company &#8220;cannot permit the dissemination&#8221; of the software.<\/p>\n<p>Regardless, several websites still retain copies of the code and are easily searchable through Google, and TechCrunch has seen several tweets linking to the WhatFreeWords code since Toponce went public with the legal threat. Tierney, who did not use WhatFreeWords as part of his research, said <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cybergibbons\/status\/1388187147560161282\">in a tweet<\/a> that What3Words&#8217; reaction was &#8220;totally unreasonable given the ease with which you can find versions online.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>In a statement, What3Words chief executive Chris Sheldrick said: &#8220;The specific incident we\u2019ve taken action against stems from an unauthorized version of our software which was offered for distribution. This includes a set of non-trivial, proprietary binary data resources. As stated in our letter, we aren\u2019t requesting that criticism of us or our software is taken offline.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>When reached, a What3Words spokesperson was unable to immediately point to a case where a judicial court has asserted that WhatFreeWords has violated its copyright.<\/p>\n<p><em>Updated with comment from What3Words.<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"TIXbhT3MWQ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/09\/talkspace-cease-desist\/\">Talkspace threatened to sue a security researcher over a bug report<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Talkspace threatened to sue a security researcher over a bug report&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/03\/09\/talkspace-cease-desist\/embed\/#?secret=TIXbhT3MWQ\" data-secret=\"TIXbhT3MWQ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A U.K. company behind digital addressing system What3Words has sent a legal threat to a security researcher for offering to share an open-source software project with other researchers, which What3Words claims violate its copyright.

The startup could <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">easily<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> use its equity to provide the capital for all the one-year loans. The payoff from the loans, after one year, would be the interest due to them. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Or, it could put that capital into hiring developers, build a go-to-market strategy, hire a CTO, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">all of<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> which would likely have payoffs that are up to a 100x <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">multiple<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> of the interest they would have made on the single SME loan that <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">is tied<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> up for an entire year<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ultimately<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, debt would be an ideal source of nondilutive capital for the startup as they wouldn\u2019t have to tie up equity for one year<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Therefore, debt would<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0be a much cheaper source of capital to scale up their operations, especially if it has scaled up to having tens of thousands of one-year loans<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. If it were equity, they would have to raise an endless amount with constant dilution as they scale.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In its five years of official operations, Lendable has given debt facilities to more than 20 startups<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the stage at which Lendable gives money differs, it is particular about startups that are post Series A.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from Carbon and FairMoney, some startups to have raised debt from Lendable include Tugende, Uploan, KoinWorks, Planet42, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/lendable\/terrapay-raises-usd-20-million-from-lendable-to-further-expand-its-digital-payment-network-7883e131829a\">TerraPay<\/a>, Watu Credit, Trella, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/lendable\/amartha-secures-debt-financing-of-up-to-usd-50-million-from-lendable-to-finance-women-led-3973340fd01a\">Amartha<\/a>, Payjoy, Solar Panda, and<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/13\/mfs-africa-leads-2-3m-seed-round-in-ugandan-fintech-startup-numida\/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MFS Africa<\/span><\/a>. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collectively<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Eyob said, Lendable has reached 1.2 million end borrowers through its partners and helped finance up to 290,000 SMEs<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"FO8XPEc58j\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/18\/with-over-1-3-million-users-nigerian-based-fintech-fairmoney-wants-to-replicate-growth-in-india\/\">With over 1.3 million users, Nigerian-based fintech FairMoney wants to replicate growth in India<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;With over 1.3 million users, Nigerian-based fintech FairMoney wants to replicate growth in India&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/18\/with-over-1-3-million-users-nigerian-based-fintech-fairmoney-wants-to-replicate-growth-in-india\/embed\/#?secret=FO8XPEc58j\" data-secret=\"FO8XPEc58j\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of the $125 million disbursed so far as debt, Eyob said the company has a default rate of about 0.01%. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reason behind this low number, Eyob reckons, is because Lendable ensures to be in constant conversation with the companies offering help, advice or connections when necessary<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;We view lending as a partnership and <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">typically<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0when both parties act in good faith, there are ways to solve problems,&#8221; Eyob said<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The debt facilities start at $2 million but can go up to over $15 million, Eyob said. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But while the global standard at which lenders pay back their debt investments is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">typically<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> 4 to 6 years, Lendable expects the companies it gives cash to do so in 3 to 4 years<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eyob pushes that founders in emerging markets should be willing to take more debt financing to scale their startups<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These days, startups tend to be high on giving out equity instead of weighing options on effectively using<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0debt in critical points when scaling<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Equity could <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">be used<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to help attract the best talent or expand into new markets.

The company employs around 60 people, and roughly a third of the company appears to have <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CaseyNewton\/status\/1388212468510380034?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">accepted buyouts<\/a> to leave, many citing new company policies.<\/p>\n<p>On Monday, <a href=\"https:\/\/world.hey.com\/jason\/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5\">Basecamp CEO Jason Fried anounced in a blog post<\/a> that employees would no longer be allowed to openly share their &#8220;societal and political discussions&#8221; at work.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Every discussion remotely related to politics, advocacy or society at large quickly spins away from pleasant,&#8221; Fried wrote. &#8220;You shouldn\u2019t have to wonder if staying out of it means you\u2019re complicit, or wading into it means you\u2019re a target.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Basecamp&#8217;s departures are significant. According to<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/fmanjoo\/status\/1388198102293569541\/photo\/2\"> Twitter posts<\/a>, Basecamp&#8217;s head of design, head of marketing and head of customer support will all depart. The company&#8217;s iOS team also appears to have quit en masse and many departing employees have been with the company for years.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">After 7 years, today is my last day at Basecamp.

Armstrong also denounced debates around &#8220;causes or political candidates&#8221; arguing that such discussions distracted from the company&#8217;s core work. About 60 members of Coinbase&#8217;s 1,200 person staff took buyouts in light of the internal policy change \u2014 a ratio that makes the exodus at Basecamp look even more dramatic.<\/p>\n<p>Like Coinbase, Basecamp was immediately criticized for muzzling its employees over important issues, many of which disproportionately impact marginalized employees.<\/p>\n<p>Drawing the line on &#8220;political&#8221; topics becomes murky very quickly for any non-white or LGBTQ employees, for whom many issues that might be seen as political in nature in some circles \u2014 the Black Lives Matter movement, for instance \u2014 are inextricably and deeply personal. It&#8217;s not a coincidence these grand stands against divisive &#8220;politics&#8221; at work issue down from white male tech executives.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re in doubt as to whether your choice of forum or topic for a discussion is appropriate, please ask before posting,&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/world.hey.com\/dhh\/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69\">Basecamp CTO David Heinemeier Hansson wrote in his own blog post<\/a>, echoing Fried.<\/p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.platformer.news\/p\/-what-really-happened-at-basecamp\">Platformer<\/a>, Fried&#8217;s missive didn&#8217;t tell the whole story. Basecamp employees instead said the tension arose from internal conversations about the company itself and its commitment to DEI work, not free-floating arguments about political candidates. Fried&#8217;s blog post does mention one particular source of tension in a roundabout way, referencing an employee-led DEI initiative that would be disbanded.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We make project management, team communication, and email software,&#8221; Fried wrote. &#8220;We are not a social impact company.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"hmrIW7LdVn\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/09\/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus\/\">Brian Armstrong&#8217;s new problem: 60-plus free agents<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Brian Armstrong&#8217;s new problem: 60-plus free agents&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/10\/09\/brian-armstrongs-new-problem-60-plus\/embed\/#?secret=hmrIW7LdVn\" data-secret=\"hmrIW7LdVn\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Following a controversial ban on political discussions earlier this week, Basecamp employees are heading for the exits.

However, the challenge with this two-sided market is: How do you get the investors to show up? It\u2019s hard enough to get retail investors, but family offices and other large check writers are even more challenging to lure.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019ve been meeting lately with an increasing number of family offices interested in investing directly into companies in lieu of via funds.

As of Q1 2021, the number of fintech startups in the U.S. crossed 10,000 for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/893954\/number-fintech-startups-by-region\/#:~:text=As%20of%20February%202021%2C%20there,in%20the%20Asia%20Pacific%20region.\">first time ever<\/a> \u2014 well more than double that if you include EMEA and APAC. There are now three fintech companies worth more than $100 billion (Paypal, Square and Shopify) with another three in the $50 billion-$100 billion club (Stripe, Adyen and Coinbase).<\/p>\n<p>Yet, as fintech companies have begun to go public, there has been a fair amount of uncertainty as to how these companies will be valued on the public markets. This is a result of fintechs being relatively new to the IPO scene compared to their consumer internet or enterprise software counterparts. In addition, fintechs employ a wide variety of business models: Some are transactional, others are recurring or have hybrid business models.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, fintechs now have a multitude of options in terms of how they choose to go public. They can take the traditional IPO route, pursue a direct listing or merge with a SPAC. Given the multitude of variables at play, valuing these companies and then predicting public market performance is anything but straightforward.<\/p>\n<p>\t<div class=\"article-block block--pullout block--left\">\n\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\tIt is important to note that fintech is a complex category with many different types of players, and not all fintech is created equal.\t\t\t\t\t<\/blockquote>\n\t<\/div>\n\t<\/p>\n<h2>The fintech gold rush has arrived<\/h2>\n<p>For much of the past two decades, fintech as a category has been very quiet on the public markets. But that began to change considerably by the mid-2010s. Fintech had clearly arrived by 2015, with both Square and Shopify going public that year. Last year was a record one with eight fintech IPOs, and there has been no slowdown in 2021 \u2014 the first four months have already produced seven IPOs. By our estimates, there are more than 15 additional fintech companies that could IPO this year.
